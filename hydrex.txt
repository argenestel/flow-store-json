What is the Hydrex Flywheel?
The Hydrex Flywheel creates sustainable growth by aligning incentives between liquidity providers, token holders, and the protocol itself.

In this system, users lock tokens into NFTs (called Flex or Protocol Accounts) to gain earning power and split 100% of protocol-generated fees weekly. The longer & larger the lock, the greater the influence and yield. Earning power is applied through voting, and as a result emissions are directed toward the voted-upon pools (Liquid Accounts). The more votes, the more emissions percentage to any given pool.

Hydrex flywheel graphic
The Hydrex Protocol creates a powerful flywheel: lock tokens, vote for pools, attract liquidity, generate fees, and repeat. When executed well, it sustains deep liquidity, boosts protocol alignment, and rewards long-term participants.

Account Types
Hydrex offers three types of accounts that represent different ways to earn and participate in the ecosystem. This accomodates several types of user demand, while rewarding protocol alignment & long-term growth.

Type	Denominated In	Rewards In	Acquired By	DeFi Equivalent
Liquid	Any Asset	oHYDX	Providing Liquidity	Staked LP
Flex	Flex-Locked HYDX	Rebased HYDX + Fees + Bribes	Locking Liquid HYDX	Traditional veTokens
Protocol	Permalocked HYDX	Rebased HYDX + Fees + Bribes	Converting oHYDX to veNFT or Rebases	Permanently Locked veTokens
Liquid Accounts
The most flexible option. Functions like lending assets & earning yield, which can increase other account balances. Earns oHYDX on a per-block basis.

Flex Accounts
Lock liquid HYDX for 2 years, giving a 30% boost in weekly earning power. Offers an early exit penalty on day 1 of the lock at 50%. This penalty decreases linearly over 2 years, and so does earning power if not relocked.

Protocol Accounts
Acquired via oHYDX conversion or through rebases. Offers 1:1 weekly earning power, and is permenantly locked. Earning power does not decrease over time.

Strategic Protocol Reserve
At the foundation of Hydrex's token model is a Strategic Protocol Reserve: every HYDX in circulation requires at least 0.01 USDC to be released into the market. This reserve mechanism is core to the protocol's economic framework, ensuring that token emissions are supported by actual capital inflow rather than unchecked inflation.

New HYDX does not enter the market directly. Instead, users earn oHYDX, an options token that represents the right to mint liquid HYDX. To convert oHYDX into liquid HYDX, users must deposit the greater of 0.01 USDC or 30% of HYDX's USD value per token. This creates a strategic reserve that provides foundational support, reinforces stability, and generates protocol-owned liquidity with every redemption.

oHYDX redemption options and reserve mechanism
The accumulated USDC will be deployed through predefined mechanisms including low-risk yield generation, strategic liquidity provision, and protocol development initiatives. The minimum value of the reserve will not drop below 0.01 USDC per HYDX, but during the bootstrapping phase, the Core Contributors may deploy excess capital on growth opportunities. Upon sufficient decentralization, the reserve management will transition to governance control.

Account Automations
Hydrex enables the automation of voting, fee collection, and more through a tool we developed called conduits. This automation is entirely optional. Advanced users can manually manage their accounts to optimize positions, voting, and fee claiming.

Flex & Protocol Account Automations

1. Select Output Asset(s)
Choose your preferred rewards

2. Votes Automated Weekly
Automation optimizes votes for rewards

3. Fees Handled
Automation claims & converts fees
Voting and weekly fee collection/conversion for Flex & Protocol Accounts costs 1% of fees to subsidize gas and automation infrastructure.
Liquid Account Automations
For Liquid Account holders, conduits enable Account Automation by automating the conversion of earned oHYDX into larger Protocol Account positions, maximizing earning power over time. By automatically converting rewards into permanently locked positions, users can compound their protocol participation without manual intervention. More automations for Liquid Accounts will be introduced as the protocol evolves.

Omni-Liquidity
Hydrex takes a liquidity-neutral approach, prioritizing user outcomes over protocol self-interest. Instead of pushing users exclusively into native pools, Hydrex routes and incentivizes liquidity through the most competitive sources to deliver optimal results.

Routing
We route through any LP on Base and give users the best rate available across all liquidity sources.

Liquidity Sourcing
For partner liquidity, we support Hydrex LPs, UniV4 LPs, and soon more decentralized exchange liquidity sources as the ecosystem expands.

Other Liquidity
We expect to incorporate other liquidity types that extend past DEX LPs, such as Morpho Vaults and additional yield-generating opportunities.

By treating liquidity as a shared resource across the entire Base ecosystem, Hydrex increases efficiency, improves returns, and builds long-term trust with both LPs and traders.

Supply & Distribution
HYDX is the native token that powers governance, rewards, and long-term alignment across the Hydrex protocol. Its initial supply and distribution are designed to balance community growth, contributor incentives, and protocol sustainability. Please note:

Initial Allocation
Category	Amount	Issuance	Uses
Community & Partner Growth Activations	50%	Locked	Community campaigns (e.g., Basedrop), partner allocations, protocol activations
Treasury	25%	22% Locked, 3% Liquid Reserve	Locked for operational expenses, audits, infrastructure, general runway. Liquid for strategic liquidity provisioning
Core Contributors	20%	Locked	Team compensation, longâ€‘term incentives, and hiring
Protocol Owned Liquidity	3%	Liquid	Seed liquidity
Advisors & Early Supporters	2%	Locked	Strategic guidance, early supporter alignment
Additional liquid reserves have been responsibly deployed to stabilize price and deepen markets. Circulating supply may increase due to Basedrop Flex Locking. You can always see the up to date circulating supply and market cap on CoinGecko here.

Rebases & Anti-Dilution
Rebase share for veHYDX holders begins at 26% of emissions and decreases by 0.5% each week for the first year, phasing out as the ecosystem matures. Rebases are proportional to existing earning power and offset dilution from new issuance.

Combined with emissions ramping and options-token redemption mechanics, this design promotes long-term engagement and sustainable growth while avoiding runaway inflation.

Options Token (oHYDX)
Liquid HYDX is the base token of the protocol, but it doesn't enter circulation freely. Each HYDX must have at least 0.01 of USDC collected before being emitted via an options token redemption (see Strategic Protocol Reserve). Users can access liquid HYDX by redeeming oHYDX and supplying the USDC or by acquiring it on the open market.

oHYDX is the options token earned through liquidity mining and other protocol incentives. It can be redeemed in two ways: permalocked into a veNFT for long-term rewards, or converted into liquid HYDX by paying USDC. This model gives users a choice between immediate liquidity and deeper protocol alignment.

HYDX, oHYDX and token options
Redeem for Liquid HYDX
Users can redeem oHYDX by supplying at least 0.01 USDC per token. The USDC is placed into the Strategic Protocol Reserve (learn more), reinforcing long-term sustainability. This creates a strategic reserve that provides foundational support, reinforces stability, and generates protocol-owned liquidity with every redemption.

Convert to Permalocked HYDX
Users can also convert their oHYDX rewards directly into Protocol Accounts (e.g., permalocked veNFTs) without supplying any USDC. Once created, these cannot be withdrawn, but they receive permanent earning power in the Hydrex protocol at a 1:1 ratio with the underlying veTokens that were locked. This is ideal for users who want long-term exposure and maximum protocol alignment.

This system ensures HYDX supply expands only when users take real action, protecting against inflation and short-term farming while giving users flexibility in how they utilize their earned rewards.

Early Exit
Flex account holders can exit their positions early by paying a penalty in unvested HYDX. This penalty is permanently burned, reducing the total HYDX supply and creating deflationary pressure.

The penalty structure starts at 50% for immediate exits after a 2-year lock, then decreases linearly over time to 0% after 2 years without relocking. For example, after 1 year, users can exit immediately by burning 25% of their underlying HYDX. This mechanism provides emergency liquidity while discouraging premature exits and maintaining protocol stability.

Earning Power
Effective earning power is the earning power that will be used to compete for fees. This earning power comes from various sources including community claims (e.g., Basedrop), partner activations, team allocations, automation delegations, and partner holdings, Any active earning power not specified in this amount does not compete for fees and is used to encourage emissions to new gauges & low-profit DEX essentials like stablecoin pairs.

ve(3,3) Refresher
Hydrex originates from the ve(3,3) model, but differs in several key ways. If you're unfamiliar with ve(3,3), here's a refresher: The ve(3,3) model combines two major innovations in DeFi: vote-escrow (ve) mechanics, which reward users for locking tokens, and the (3,3) game theory from Olympus DAO, which incentivizes cooperative staking behavior.

In this system, users lock tokens into NFTs (veTokens) to gain governance power and earn protocol rewards. The larger the lock, the greater the influence and earning power. This happens through weekly voting. The pools/gauges with the most votes, receive the most emissions, aligning incentives between voters, LPs, and protocols.

ve(3,3) flywheel graphic
ve(3,3) creates a powerful flywheel: lock tokens, vote for pools, attract liquidity, generate fees, and repeat. When executed well, it sustains deep liquidity, boosts protocol alignment, and rewards long-term participants.

Hydrex builds on this foundation with different lock types, reserve-conscious emissions, and a UX that finally makes the model accessible to everyone.

Mental Mapping

Early Exit Ability: veTokens/Accounts created with liquid HYDX can be released at any time by taking a vesting penalty. This penalty is burned.
Account Automations: Delegate not just voting power, but your entire involvement in the flywheel.
Omni-liquidity: Gauges are not limited to native LPs.
Multiple Lock Types: Flex vs Permalocked to accomodate different users.
Single Deposit LPs
We offer ALM strategies (via Ichi) that let you deposit a single asset and participate in a managed LP position. On withdrawal, you receive approximately a 70/30 split of the pair, reflecting the current pool state.

How it works:
Deposit one token of the pair â€” no manual ratioing needed
Strategy actively manages a concentrated LP position
Withdrawals return an estimated 70/30 split of assets
Why it matters:
Maximizes capital efficiency
Minimizes impermanent loss
No active rebalancing or management required
Note: Actual withdrawal ratios may vary due to price movement, fees, and position rebalancing.

Native Liquidity Types
While Hydrex abstracts much of the liquidity experience across LP types and ALMs, we do offer in-house LPs types.
