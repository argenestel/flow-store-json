PROTOCOLS
LP’s
The protocol is designed to enable token swaps and generate fees (from Traders) by attracting liquidity.
Every epoch liquidity providers (LPs) receive $AERO token emissions proportionally to the votes the pools accumulate. Only staked (in the protocol gauges) liquidity receive emissions.
Participants can lock their $AERO to be able to vote on the next epoch distribution of emissions, becoming veAERO Voters.
veAERO Voters are rewarded (proportionally to locked amounts) for their votes with 100% of the protocol trading fees from the previous epoch and any additional voters incentives from the current epoch.
An epoch is a 7-day period. It starts every Thursday at 00:00 UTC and ends Wednesday at 23:59 UTC. Votes, emissions, fees, and incentives are calculated for each epoch.
Tokenomics
Aerodrome Finance uses two tokens to manage its utility and governance:

$AERO — ERC-20 utility token of the protocol
$veAERO — ERC-721 governance token in the form of an NFT (non-fungible token)
$AERO is distributed to liquidity providers through emissions.

$veAERO is used for governance. Any $AERO holder can vote-escrow their tokens and receive a $veAERO (also known as Lock or veNFT) in exchange. Additional tokens can be added to the $veAERO NFT at any time.

The lock period (also known as vote-escrowed period, hence the ve prefix) can be up to 4 years, following the linear relationship shown below:

100 $AERO locked for 4 years will become 100 $veAERO
100 $AERO locked for 1 year will become 25 $veAERO
The longer the vesting time, the higher the voting power (voting weight) of the underlying locked balance.

Additionally, Aerodrome Locks (veNFTs) can be set into Auto-Max Lock, which are treated by the protocol as being locked for the maximum duration of 4 years, and their voting power does not decay. The Auto-Max Lock feature can be turned on and off for each Lock (veNFT).

Initial Distribution
AERO	Amount	Percentage
Voter Incentives	40M	8%
Genesis Liquidity Incentives	10M	2%
veAERO	Amount	Percentage
Airdrop for veVELO Lockers	200M	40%
Public Goods Fund (Auto Max-Locked)	105M	21%
Development Team Funding (Auto Max-Locked)	95M	19%
Flight School (Auto Max-Locked)	50M	10%
Emissions
The initial supply of $AERO is 500M, with 450M distributed as vote-locked ($veAERO) tokens.

Weekly emissions will begin at 10M $AERO (2% of the initial supply). The emission schedule will follow three phases:

Take-off: During the first 14 weeks (epochs), emissions will increase at 3% per week, allowing for rapid growth in protocol activity and partner onboarding.

Cruise: After Epoch 14, emissions will decay at 1% per epoch, ensuring total supply inflation decreases over time as the protocol matures.

Aero Fed: When emissions programmatically drop under 9M per epoch, approximately Epoch 67, veAERO voters will take control of Aerodrome's monetary policy through the Aero Fed system. Voters will collectively make one of three choices each epoch:

Increase emissions by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
Decrease emissions by 0.01% of total supply (0.52% annualized)
Maintain emissions unchanged as a % of total supply
The winning vote will be determined by simple majority vote. If an Increase or Decrease is selected, the emission rate will change one full epoch after the vote. A max emission rate will be set at 1% of total supply per week (52% annualized) and a minimum rate at 0.01% per week (0.52% annualized).

Rebase
$veAERO holders receive a rebase proportional to $AERO emissions and to the ratio of $veAERO to $AERO supply, reducing vote power dilution for $veAERO!


The weekly rebase amount is calculated with the following formula:

rebase = weeklyEmissions × (1 - veAERO.totalSupply ÷ AERO.totalsupply)ˆ2 × 0.5

This rebase formula will reward $veAERO holders most when locking rates decrease, incentivizing new lockers to step in. $veAERO supply does not affect weekly emissions distributed to liquidity providers.


Projected Emission Schedule
Note: projection below uses a 40% emissions lock rate and assumes Aero Fed keeps emissions constant.



Emission Rewards
Each epoch, $AERO emissions are distributed to liquidity pools proportionally to the $veAERO voting power the pools receive.

Liquidity providers (LPs) can stake their LP positions to receive a share of the $AERO distributed to each pool proportionally to the size of positions and time staked.

These rewards are distributed during the whole epoch and available for claiming as these accrue.

Team Emissions
While a fully autonomous and immutable protocol is an admirable objective, it comes at a cost. Aerodrome will ensure its long-term sustainability by employing a dedicated team focused on supporting the product decentralization, documentation, community, and ecosystem.

To cover ongoing expenses and all the upcoming development efforts, 5% of the emissions will be going to the team address.

Aerodrome Finance: An In-Depth Analysis of the Base Ecosystem's Liquidity Engine
I. Executive Summary
Aerodrome Finance has rapidly established itself as the indispensable economic cornerstone of the Base network, an Ethereum Layer 2 solution developed by Coinbase. Launched in August 2023, the protocol functions as a next-generation automated market maker (AMM) and decentralized exchange (DEX), but its strategic importance transcends this classification. Through a sophisticated and highly effective economic model known as "ve(3,3)," Aerodrome has engineered a powerful, self-reinforcing flywheel that aligns the incentives of all ecosystem participants—liquidity providers, token holders, traders, and partner protocols. This has allowed it to capture a dominant market share of both liquidity and trading volume on Base, positioning it not merely as a first mover, but as a structurally superior liquidity engine with a defensible long-term moat.

The protocol's technical architecture is a "meta-DEX" by design, strategically integrating the most effective AMM models from DeFi's leading protocols. It combines the classic constant product formula of Uniswap V2 for volatile assets, the low-slippage StableSwap invariant from Curve for pegged assets, and a custom implementation of concentrated liquidity, Slipstream, for unparalleled capital efficiency akin to Uniswap V3. This hybrid approach, governed by a universal router, ensures optimal trade execution across a diverse range of asset types.   

However, the true innovation lies in its economic engine. The ve(3,3) model solves the "mercenary capital" problem that plagues traditional liquidity mining programs by transforming protocol governance into the central value-accrual mechanism. By requiring users to lock the native AERO token for up to four years to receive a vote-escrowed veAERO NFT, the protocol fosters a community of long-term stakeholders. Crucially, these veAERO holders direct weekly AERO token emissions to liquidity pools and, in return, receive 100% of the trading fees and external incentives (bribes) generated by the specific pools they vote for. This direct link between a voter's action and their financial return ensures that liquidity is allocated to the most productive, high-volume pools, creating a virtuous cycle of deep liquidity, low slippage, increased trading volume, and higher rewards for engaged governors.   

This analysis concludes that Aerodrome Finance is more than a DEX; it is a foundational piece of financial infrastructure for the Base ecosystem. Its symbiotic relationship with Velodrome Finance on Optimism, its backing from the Base Ecosystem Fund, and its innovative B2B service model—providing "Liquidity-as-a-Service" to other protocols—cement its strategic position. While risks related to smart contract security, impermanent loss, and long-term tokenomics management persist, the protocol's design represents a significant evolution in decentralized liquidity provision. Its continued success is intrinsically linked to the growth of the Base network, making it a critical barometer and driver of the ecosystem's overall economic health.

II. Introduction to Aerodrome Finance: The Central Liquidity Hub on Base
Aerodrome Finance emerged within the decentralized finance (DeFi) landscape with a clear and ambitious mandate: to serve as the central liquidity hub for the Base network. Its launch on August 28, 2023, was not an isolated event but a strategic deployment timed to coincide with the nascent growth of Base, an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) blockchain incubated and developed by the digital asset exchange Coinbase. This positioning was deliberate, designed to establish the protocol as the foundational layer for trading and liquidity provision, thereby capturing the economic activity of the burgeoning ecosystem from its inception.   

The protocol's core mission is to address and solve the pervasive issue of liquidity fragmentation that often plagues new blockchain ecosystems. In a fragmented environment, liquidity for token pairs is scattered across multiple, competing decentralized exchanges. This results in a suboptimal experience for all participants: traders face high slippage (the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which it is executed) due to shallow order books, and liquidity providers (LPs) earn fewer fees from diminished trading volume. Aerodrome's objective is to create a single, deep, and highly efficient marketplace that consolidates liquidity, thereby offering low slippage for traders, robust incentives for LPs, and a capital-efficient venue for other protocols to build liquidity for their native tokens.   

The Velodrome Lineage
Aerodrome Finance's credibility and technical robustness are significantly bolstered by its origins. The protocol was developed by the same team responsible for Velodrome Finance, the leading DEX on the Optimism network. Aerodrome is not merely inspired by its predecessor; it is a direct fork of the Velodrome V2 smart contract codebase, inheriting its battle-tested architecture, security profile, and advanced features. This relationship is fundamental to understanding Aerodrome's strategy and rapid ascent. By leveraging a proven technology stack, the development team was able to bypass many of the early challenges of protocol design and security auditing, allowing for a swift and confident deployment onto the Base network.   

This "sister protocol" strategy represents a deliberate and scalable expansion model. The success of Velodrome on Optimism served as a proof-of-concept for the efficacy of the underlying ve(3,3) economic model. The decision to launch Aerodrome as a distinct entity on Base, rather than simply deploying Velodrome cross-chain, was a strategic choice. It allowed for the creation of a new, native token (AERO) and a self-contained economic flywheel tailored specifically to the unique partnerships and requirements of the Base ecosystem. This approach fosters a stronger sense of native identity and allows the protocol's monetary policy to be governed directly by Base ecosystem participants.   

Furthermore, this model aligns perfectly with the broader "Superchain" vision, which envisions a network of interoperable L2s built on the OP Stack (the technology underpinning Optimism). The Velodrome and Aerodrome team has effectively positioned its ve(3,3) DEX architecture as the premier, go-to liquidity infrastructure for this expanding network. This creates a powerful development synergy; innovations and upgrades, such as the introduction of concentrated liquidity via Slipstream, can be developed once and then deployed across both Velodrome and Aerodrome, enhancing the value proposition of the entire family of protocols. This contrasts with the more monolithic, chain-agnostic strategies of competitors, which may lack the tailored focus and deep ecosystem integration that Aerodrome has achieved on Base.

III. Technical Architecture: A 'Meta' Automated Market Maker (AMM)
Aerodrome Finance's technical architecture is engineered to be a "meta" decentralized exchange, a term that signifies its design philosophy of integrating multiple, proven AMM models into a single, cohesive, and highly optimized protocol. This approach avoids reinventing core functionalities and instead focuses on combining the best elements of existing, successful DEXs to create a platform that is greater than the sum of its parts. By doing so, Aerodrome provides a versatile and capital-efficient trading environment capable of handling a wide variety of asset types without imposing extractive middle layers that siphon value from users.   

Core AMM Components
The platform's versatility is rooted in its support for three distinct types of liquidity pools, each tailored to a specific category of token pairs.

Volatile Pools (Uniswap V2 Model)
For the vast majority of token pairs where prices are expected to fluctuate independently (e.g., AERO/WETH), Aerodrome employs the classic constant product formula, mathematically expressed as x×y=k. This model, pioneered by Uniswap V2, is the bedrock of modern AMMs. It ensures that liquidity is available across the entire price spectrum, from zero to infinity. While not the most capital-efficient model, its simplicity, robustness, and reliability make it an ideal foundation for general-purpose trading of uncorrelated assets.   

Stable Pools (Curve Finance Model)
Recognizing the limitations of the constant product formula for assets that are pegged to one another, Aerodrome integrates the StableSwap invariant, first developed by Curve Finance. This model is specifically designed for pairs of assets that should trade at or very near a 1:1 ratio, such as different types of stablecoins (e.g., USDC/USDbC) or various liquid staked derivatives of Ether (e.g., cbETH/WETH). The StableSwap algorithm creates a highly concentrated band of liquidity around the peg, allowing for extremely large trades with minimal slippage. This is critical for a network's central liquidity hub, as stablecoin swaps often constitute a significant portion of total trading volume.   

Concentrated Liquidity (Slipstream)
The most advanced component of Aerodrome's architecture is Slipstream, its custom implementation of concentrated liquidity pools. Functionally analogous to Uniswap V3, Slipstream allows liquidity providers to allocate their capital within specific, user-defined price ranges rather than across the entire price curve. This innovation represents a paradigm shift in capital efficiency. For example, an LP in a USDC/WETH pool might concentrate their liquidity in the $3,000 to $4,000 price range for WETH, rather than spreading it from $0 to infinity.   

By doing so, the LP's capital is used more effectively to facilitate trades within the most active price band, earning them a proportionally larger share of trading fees. The protocol documentation suggests that Slipstream can facilitate up to 10 times higher trading volume per unit of Total Value Locked (TVL) compared to standard AMM pools. This feature is paramount for attracting sophisticated LPs and for offering traders the best possible execution prices, directly competing with the most advanced AMMs in the DeFi space.   

Universal Protocol Router
To seamlessly integrate these disparate pool types, Aerodrome employs a sophisticated Universal Protocol Router. When a user initiates a swap, this router intelligently analyzes the trade request and determines the most efficient execution path. It can split trades across multiple pools and pool types—volatile, stable, and Slipstream—to find the combination that results in the lowest possible slippage and the best final price for the user. This backend complexity is abstracted away from the end-user, who simply experiences a fast and efficient trade, solidifying the platform's user-friendly appeal while leveraging a powerful and multifaceted liquidity infrastructure.   

IV. The ve(3,3) Flywheel: An In-Depth Analysis of Aerodrome's Economic Engine
The defining feature of Aerodrome Finance, and the primary driver of its success, is its innovative economic model, commonly referred to as the "ve(3,3)" system. This sophisticated tokenomics structure is not merely an add-on but the core engine of the protocol, designed to create a powerful, self-sustaining "flywheel" that aligns the incentives of all stakeholders and fosters the growth of "sticky," long-term liquidity. To fully appreciate its impact, it is essential to deconstruct its conceptual foundations and the precise mechanics of its operation.   

Conceptual Foundations of ve(3,3)
The ve(3,3) model is a synthesis of two of the most influential tokenomic concepts to emerge from previous DeFi cycles.

Vote Escrow ('ve')
Pioneered by Curve Finance, the Vote Escrow model is a mechanism designed to reward long-term commitment to a protocol. The core principle involves users locking the protocol's native token for a specified period. In return, they receive a non-transferable governance token (or, in Aerodrome's case, an NFT) that grants them voting power and a claim on the protocol's revenue. The key innovation is that the amount of voting power received is directly proportional to the duration of the lock; a longer lock confers greater influence and higher rewards. This system filters for participants with a long-term conviction in the protocol's success.   

(3,3) Game Theory
Derived from the OlympusDAO protocol, the "(3,3)" concept is an application of game theory, specifically the prisoner's dilemma, to protocol tokenomics. It posits that in a system where participants can choose to stake, bond, or sell their tokens, the optimal outcome for the collective—and thus for each individual in the long run—is for everyone to stake. This cooperative action is denoted as (3,3). Conversely, the worst possible outcome, where the protocol's value is eroded, occurs when all participants choose to sell, denoted as (-1,-1). The model aims to create strong incentives that encourage the cooperative (3,3) behavior, leading to value accretion for the protocol and its token holders.   

Aerodrome's ve(3,3) model ingeniously fuses these two concepts. It uses the vote-escrow mechanism to encourage long-term token locking and then channels the resulting governance power into a system where the most profitable action for an individual voter is also the most beneficial action for the protocol as a whole, creating the desired (3,3) dynamic.   

The Dual-Token System
The ve(3,3) model operates through a carefully designed dual-token system:

AERO (ERC-20): This is the protocol's liquid utility token. Its fundamental role is to serve as the reward mechanism for liquidity providers who deposit their assets into Aerodrome's pools. LPs receive AERO emissions as compensation for their service and for bearing the risk of impermanent loss. AERO can be freely traded on the open market or, more importantly, locked to participate in governance.   

veAERO (ERC-721 NFT): When a user locks their AERO tokens, they receive a vote-escrowed AERO, or veAERO, position in the form of an ERC-721 non-fungible token. This NFT represents their locked balance and their corresponding voting power. The voting power scales linearly with the lock duration, up to a maximum of four years. For instance, locking 100 AERO for four years grants the user 100 veAERO in voting power, whereas locking the same amount for one year grants only 25 veAERO. A critical feature is that this veAERO NFT is transferable and can be sold on secondary NFT marketplaces, providing a degree of liquidity for what would otherwise be a completely illiquid, long-term position.   

Mechanics of the Flywheel - How Value is Generated and Circulated
The genius of the ve(3,3) model lies in the intricate, cyclical flow of value it creates. The process unfolds in a weekly cycle, known as an "epoch."

Emissions: The protocol's smart contracts mint a predetermined amount of new AERO tokens each week to be used as incentives.   

Voting: Holders of veAERO NFTs cast votes to determine how these new AERO emissions will be distributed among the various liquidity pools on the platform.   

LP Incentives: Liquidity providers, seeking to maximize their yield, are naturally attracted to the pools that receive the highest percentage of votes and thus the largest share of AERO emissions. They deposit their token pairs into these designated pools, which deepens their liquidity.   

Trading & Fees: The deepened liquidity in the highly-voted pools leads to lower slippage for traders. This superior trading experience attracts more trading volume to the platform, as users and aggregators route their trades through the most efficient pools. Every trade conducted on the platform generates a small fee.   

Value Accrual to Voters: This is the most critical step in the cycle. 100% of the trading fees generated by any given liquidity pool are distributed directly to the veAERO holders who voted for that specific pool. The distribution is proportional to each voter's share of the total votes cast for that pool.   

External Incentives ("Bribes"): The system is further amplified by external incentives. Other DeFi protocols that wish to build deep liquidity for their own native tokens can offer additional rewards, known as "bribes," to veAERO holders. These bribes, which can be paid in any token (e.g., the protocol's own token, USDC, or WETH), are offered to persuade veAERO holders to direct AERO emissions toward their specific liquidity pool. These bribes are also distributed to the voters of that pool.   

Reinforcement Loop: The combination of trading fees and bribes creates a compelling, high-yield revenue stream for veAERO holders. This incentivizes two key behaviors: first, it encourages more users to buy and lock AERO to acquire veAERO and participate in this revenue generation. Second, and more importantly, it incentivizes existing veAERO holders to vote intelligently. To maximize their personal returns, they must vote for pools that either generate high trading volume (and thus high fees) or attract significant bribes. This directs AERO emissions to the most economically productive areas of the protocol, which in turn attracts more LPs, creating a powerful, self-reinforcing feedback loop.   

This elegant mechanism directly solves the core incentive misalignment problem found in many other DeFi protocols. In a model like Curve's, for example, a veCRV holder receives a share of all protocol fees, regardless of where they direct their vote. This creates a scenario where a large holder can accept a bribe to vote for an unproductive, low-volume pool, thereby misallocating protocol emissions, without suffering any direct financial penalty to their fee revenue.   

Aerodrome's design rectifies this flaw. By tying a voter's rewards directly to the fee performance of the pool they support, it creates a direct financial disincentive for poor governance. A voter who directs emissions to a pool that generates no volume will receive no fee revenue. This transforms governance from a passive, often-neglected feature into the central, active, and value-accretive process of the entire protocol. It ensures that the protocol's capital incentives are directed by stakeholders who have a long-term, vested financial interest in its overall success and efficiency. This fosters the creation of "sticky" liquidity, as the entire system is optimized for sustainability rather than the short-term, yield-hopping behavior characteristic of "mercenary capital." The veAERO NFT thus becomes more than a governance token; it represents a capital asset that is a direct claim on the future fee-generating capacity of the Base ecosystem's primary economic engine.

V. AERO Tokenomics: Supply, Distribution, and Monetary Policy
A thorough analysis of Aerodrome Finance requires a deep dive into the quantitative aspects of its native token, AERO. The token's design, initial allocation, and the rules governing its ongoing supply are critical components of the ve(3,3) flywheel and determine the long-term sustainability and decentralization of the protocol. Aerodrome employs a sophisticated, multi-phase monetary policy designed to aggressively bootstrap liquidity in its early stages while transitioning to a mature, community-governed model over time.

Initial Supply and Distribution
At its launch, Aerodrome established an initial total supply of 500 million AERO tokens. A defining feature of its launch strategy was the decision to immediately lock 450 million of these tokens, or 90% of the initial supply, as veAERO. This was a deliberate choice to establish a large and committed base of long-term governors from the very beginning, ensuring the stability and integrity of the voting process. The distribution of this initial supply was strategically allocated to various stakeholders to maximize ecosystem alignment and growth.

Emissions Schedule and Monetary Policy
Aerodrome's token emissions, the primary incentive for liquidity providers, are governed by a carefully structured, three-phase schedule designed to adapt to the protocol's stage of maturity.

Data compiled from.   

The "Aero Fed": Decentralized Monetary Policy
The transition to Phase 3 marks a pivotal moment in the protocol's decentralization. Termed the "Aero Fed," this mechanism hands over control of the AERO inflation rate to the veAERO holders. Each week, the community of governors collectively votes on one of three options: increase emissions, decrease emissions, or maintain the current rate. The changes are capped at 0.01% of the total supply per week, with hard-coded boundaries for the annualized emission rate, which can range from a minimum of 0.52% to a maximum of 52%.   

This system is a powerful tool for long-term sustainability. During periods of high growth and demand for liquidity on Base, veAERO holders can vote to increase emissions to attract more LPs. Conversely, during market downturns or periods of high inflation, they can vote to reduce emissions to protect the value of the AERO token. This allows the protocol's monetary policy to be highly responsive to the needs of the ecosystem, managed by its most committed stakeholders.

The Rebase Mechanism
A key challenge in any vote-escrowed model is that ongoing token emissions can dilute the voting power and value share of existing locked positions. Aerodrome addresses this with a weekly "rebase" mechanism. Each week, a portion of the new emissions is distributed directly to veAERO holders as additional locked AERO, effectively increasing the size of their positions to counteract the dilution.   

The rebase is calculated using the following formula:

Rebase=(veAERO.totalSupply÷AERO.totalSupply) 
2
 ×0.5×Emissions
This formula has a crucial property: the rebase is proportionally larger when the percentage of the total AERO supply that is locked as veAERO is lower. This creates a powerful counter-balancing incentive. If many users unlock their AERO and the lock rate drops, the weekly rebase for the remaining veAERO holders becomes significantly more generous. This encourages new lockers to step in to capture the higher yield, helping to maintain a healthy and stable ratio of locked tokens and ensuring the long-term viability of the governance system.   

VI. Performance Analysis and On-Chain Metrics
An assessment of Aerodrome's strategic success and market position must be grounded in empirical, on-chain data. The protocol's performance since its launch provides compelling evidence of its effectiveness as a liquidity engine and its rapid achievement of a dominant position within the Base ecosystem. Key metrics such as Total Value Locked (TVL), trading volume, and revenue generation illustrate a story of explosive growth and market capture.

Total Value Locked (TVL)
TVL is a primary metric for measuring the scale and user trust in a DeFi protocol, representing the total value of assets deposited by users into its smart contracts. From its inception, Aerodrome has consistently dominated the TVL rankings on the Base network.

Market Dominance: The protocol quickly became the largest on Base by TVL, with figures frequently exceeding $600 million and reaching peaks even higher. This represents a significant portion of the entire network's DeFi activity. At various points, Aerodrome has accounted for over 35%, and sometimes more than 40%, of the total value locked across all DeFi applications on Base, highlighting its role as the ecosystem's gravitational center for capital. This dominance is not just a reflection of being an early mover but an indicator of the ve(3,3) model's powerful ability to attract and retain capital.   

Trading Volume and Revenue
While TVL indicates the amount of liquidity, trading volume reflects the actual economic activity and utility of the platform. High trading volume is the ultimate goal for any DEX, as it directly translates into fees and revenue.

Explosive Volume Growth: Aerodrome has demonstrated remarkable growth in trading volume, quickly becoming the primary venue for swaps on Base. Data shows 30-day trading volumes reaching extraordinary levels, often in the tens of billions of dollars. For instance, various data aggregators have reported 30-day volumes in the range of $19 billion to $20 billion. This level of activity rivals that of established DEXs on much larger networks.   

Substantial Revenue Generation: The protocol's design, which directs 100% of trading fees to veAERO holders, makes it one of the highest-earning protocols in all of DeFi from a token holder's perspective. The high trading volume translates directly into substantial revenue. Annualized revenue figures, calculated by extrapolating recent fee generation, have been observed in the hundreds of millions of dollars, with some sources reporting figures upwards of $184 million. This robust cash flow to veAERO holders is the fuel that powers the entire economic flywheel, validating the model's ability to create a sustainable, revenue-generating ecosystem.   

Liquidity Provider (LP) Yields
Understanding the incentive structure for liquidity providers is crucial, as they form the supply side of the DEX's market. A key distinction of Aerodrome's model is how these LPs are compensated.

Emission-Based Yields: Unlike traditional AMMs like Uniswap, where LPs earn a direct share of the trading fees from their pool, LPs on Aerodrome are compensated entirely through AERO token emissions. They receive no portion of the swap fees; these are reserved exclusively for veAERO voters.   

Governance-Determined APR: Consequently, the Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for providing liquidity to any given pool is a direct function of two main variables: the market price of the AERO token and the percentage of the total weekly emissions that are directed to that pool by veAERO voters. This makes the weekly governance vote the single most important determinant of LP yields across the platform. LPs must monitor voting patterns and anticipate where emissions will flow to effectively "farm" AERO rewards. This dynamic further reinforces the centrality of the veAERO governance process, as it directly controls the flow of incentives to the capital providers.   

VII. Competitive Landscape: Aerodrome's Strategic Positioning
Aerodrome Finance does not operate in a vacuum. It competes in the highly contested decentralized exchange sector, which is dominated by established incumbents like Uniswap and Curve Finance. However, Aerodrome's strategic advantages stem from its unique design, which represents a direct evolution of these earlier models, and its laser focus on a single, high-growth ecosystem. A comparative analysis reveals the specific ways in which Aerodrome has innovated to build a competitive moat.

The table below provides a high-level comparison of Aerodrome's core mechanics against its primary competitors, Uniswap and Curve.

Aerodrome vs. Uniswap
Uniswap is the undisputed market leader in terms of brand recognition and overall trading volume across all of DeFi. Its primary competitive advantage lies in its pioneering of the AMM model and its continuous innovation in capital efficiency with Uniswap V3 and the forthcoming V4. However, its core design has a significant structural difference from Aerodrome's.

Uniswap's model is fundamentally geared towards rewarding liquidity providers, who receive the entirety of the trading fees. The UNI governance token has historically been a "valueless" governance token, with no direct mechanism for revenue sharing. While a "fee switch" exists that could divert a portion of fees to the protocol treasury or UNI holders, its activation has been a subject of intense and prolonged debate, highlighting a lack of consensus on value accrual.

Aerodrome's primary advantage over Uniswap is its powerful, built-in incentive layer. The ve(3,3) model creates a compelling reason to hold and lock the native token, directly rewarding long-term stakeholders with 100% of protocol revenue. This system is designed to cultivate "sticky" liquidity by aligning the goals of the protocol with its governors. In contrast, liquidity on Uniswap can be more "mercenary," with LPs moving their capital to whichever platform offers the highest immediate returns from fees. While Uniswap's capital efficiency is a powerful draw, Aerodrome competes by creating a more robust and sustainable economic ecosystem around its liquidity.   

Aerodrome vs. Curve
Aerodrome can be best understood as a direct evolution and refinement of the model pioneered by Curve Finance. Both protocols use a vote-escrow system to direct token emissions. However, Aerodrome implements two critical improvements that address well-documented shortcomings in the Curve model.   

Fixing Incentive Alignment: As detailed previously, Curve's fee distribution is mutualized. All veCRV holders receive a proportional share of 50% of the total fees generated across the entire protocol, regardless of which pools they voted for. This disconnects a voter's action from their reward, creating the potential for inefficient or even detrimental capital allocation driven by bribes. Aerodrome solves this by ensuring voters only receive fees from the pools they actively support. This simple but profound change aligns the financial self-interest of the voter with the overall health of the DEX, as the most profitable action is to vote for the most productive, high-volume pools.   

Eliminating Complexity and Capture: Curve's model includes a complex "LP boost" mechanism, which allows veCRV holders to multiply the CRV rewards they earn on their own liquidity positions. This system was so complex and capital-intensive to maximize that it led to the creation of a meta-protocol, Convex Finance, which aggregated CRV and veCRV to offer a simplified boosting service to users. Over time, Convex came to control a majority of the voting power in the Curve ecosystem, effectively becoming a layer between the user and the protocol. Aerodrome deliberately forgoes this boost mechanism entirely. This design choice simplifies the user experience and, more importantly, prevents the same kind of protocol-on-protocol capture. The economic incentives are more direct and transparent, fostering a more resilient and decentralized governance structure.   

VIII. Security Posture and Risk Assessment
A comprehensive evaluation of any DeFi protocol must include a rigorous assessment of its security measures and a transparent acknowledgment of the inherent risks faced by its users. Aerodrome Finance's security posture is built upon a foundation of inherited, battle-tested code, but like all on-chain applications, it is not without potential vulnerabilities and economic risks.

Smart Contract Security and Audits
Aerodrome's core security proposition is its direct lineage from Velodrome V2. By forking an established and operational codebase, the protocol significantly mitigated the risks associated with deploying entirely new and untested smart contracts.

Inherited Audits: The protocol's official documentation states that it inherits the full contract architecture and security maintenance from Velodrome V2. The Velodrome V2 codebase has been subjected to audits by established security firms, and the results and ongoing bug bounty program for Velodrome are, by extension, relevant to Aerodrome's security. This reliance on a proven and audited foundation provides a substantial degree of confidence in the technical integrity of the core contracts.   

Open-Source Code: The smart contracts for Aerodrome are open-source and available for public inspection, fostering transparency and allowing for community-led peer review.   

Automated Scans: Independent automated scanning tools provide a surface-level view of contract security. A scan by Cyberscope, for example, assigned Aerodrome a security score of 72%. It flagged a "Warning" for the contract's minting capabilities. This is an expected finding, as the ability to mint new AERO tokens for emissions is a fundamental and intentional part of the protocol's design, not an unforeseen vulnerability.   

Emergency Safeguards: The protocol is overseen by an "Emergency Council," a multi-signature wallet controlled by members of the Aerodrome team and other prominent figures in the ecosystem. This council has specific, limited powers to intervene in emergency situations, such as the ability to "kill" a compromised liquidity pool gauge to halt emissions or to revive a gauge after a threat has been neutralized. This provides a crucial backstop to mitigate the damage from certain types of exploits or economic attacks.   

Risk Assessment Matrix
Despite these security measures, users interacting with Aerodrome Finance face several categories of risk. The nature of these risks varies depending on the type of participant.

Key User-Centric Risks Explained
Impermanent Loss (IL): This is a fundamental and unavoidable risk for anyone providing liquidity to an AMM with volatile assets. It is the opportunity cost incurred when the price ratio of the two assets in a pool changes after they have been deposited. The greater the price divergence, the greater the impermanent loss. While LPs earn AERO emissions to compensate for this risk, it is possible for the impermanent loss to exceed the value of the rewards earned, resulting in a net loss compared to simply holding the original tokens.   

Smart Contract Vulnerability: While the codebase has been audited, no audit can guarantee the complete absence of bugs. A novel exploit or a vulnerability in an integrated component could potentially lead to a loss of user funds. The shared codebase with Velodrome also means that a vulnerability discovered in one protocol could potentially affect the other.   

veAERO Lock Risk: The decision to lock AERO for up to four years is a significant commitment and represents the primary risk for governance participants. During this period, the user cannot access their underlying AERO tokens. While the veAERO NFT can be sold, the secondary market for these locked positions may be illiquid and typically involves selling at a substantial discount to the spot price of AERO, reflecting the time-lock constraint.   

IX. Governance in Practice: The Role of the veAERO Holder
Aerodrome's governance model is not a peripheral feature; it is the central mechanism through which the protocol's economic activity is coordinated and its value is distributed. The role of the veAERO holder is an active one, requiring weekly participation to direct the flow of liquidity and maximize personal returns. The protocol has built several features to facilitate and incentivize this active engagement.

The Weekly Governance Cycle
The protocol operates on a weekly cycle, or "epoch". Every Thursday at 00:00 UTC, the voting period ends, and the distribution of AERO emissions for the following week is locked in based on the final vote tally. During the week, veAERO holders can allocate their voting power across any number of liquidity pools. This constant, cyclical process of capital allocation is the heartbeat of the protocol, ensuring that liquidity incentives are continuously adjusted to meet the evolving needs of the market.   

The Bribe Marketplace
To streamline the process of attracting votes, Aerodrome has integrated a bribe marketplace directly into its user interface. This allows other protocols or interested parties to easily post "bribes" for specific pools. A veAERO holder can browse this marketplace and see the potential yield, quoted as an APR, that they could earn from bribes by voting for a particular pool. This creates a transparent and efficient market for voting power, allowing new projects to directly and openly compete for the attention of veAERO governors and, by extension, the liquidity of the platform's LPs.   

Ecosystem Incentive Programs
To further encourage long-term locking and governance participation, Aerodrome has implemented unique incentive programs.

Flight School: This is a recurring incentive program designed to reward users who commit to the ecosystem by creating new veAERO locks. To qualify for a "class," a user must lock a minimum amount of AERO (e.g., 2,500) for a set period. At the end of the class, a pool of bonus veAERO is distributed proportionally to all qualifying participants. Since its launch, this program has distributed tens of millions of AERO in bonus rewards, creating a powerful incentive to lock tokens beyond the standard fee and bribe revenue.   

Coinbase One Integration: In a clear demonstration of the deep, synergistic relationship between Aerodrome and the broader Coinbase ecosystem, members of the Coinbase One subscription service receive a 1.3x weighting on their locks when calculating their share of Flight School bonuses. This integration provides a tangible benefit to Coinbase's most engaged users, creating a powerful user acquisition funnel for Aerodrome and reinforcing its status as the officially supported liquidity hub on Base.   

The combination of these features positions Aerodrome's governance system as more than just a tool for community decision-making; it functions as a sophisticated B2B (Business-to-Business) service layer for the entire Base ecosystem. For any new protocol launching on Base, establishing deep and reliable liquidity for its native token is a critical and often expensive challenge. Traditionally, this would require the project to fund its own liquidity mining program, spending its own tokens to incentivize LPs.

Aerodrome offers a far more capital-efficient alternative. Instead of building their own incentive program from scratch, protocols can "rent" liquidity from Aerodrome's vast and established network of LPs. They can do this by either acquiring and locking AERO to direct emissions themselves or, more commonly, by offering bribes to existing veAERO holders. This transforms Aerodrome into a "Liquidity-as-a-Service" provider.   

This B2B model creates a profound network effect. The more protocols that build on Base, the greater the demand for Aerodrome's liquidity services. This increased demand translates into more bribes and a higher value proposition for holding veAERO, which in turn attracts more locked capital and deepens the platform's overall liquidity. Aerodrome's success becomes intrinsically linked to the success of every other project on Base. Each new application that launches is not a competitor, but a potential new "customer" for its governance market, solidifying its moat and making it increasingly difficult for any other DEX to displace it as the ecosystem's central economic hub.

X. Future Outlook and Strategic Trajectory
Aerodrome Finance has achieved a commanding position as the liquidity backbone of the Base network in a remarkably short period. Its future trajectory, however, will be determined by its ability to maintain this competitive edge, adapt to the evolving DeFi landscape, and capitalize on the growth of its host ecosystem. The protocol's strategic roadmap and inherent growth vectors suggest a promising future, though not one without significant challenges.

Roadmap and Future Developments
While a formal, long-term public roadmap is not always maintained, the development team's actions and the protocol's design point toward several key areas of future focus. Drawing from the continuous innovation at its sister protocol, Velodrome, future developments for Aerodrome are likely to include :   

Enhanced Analytics and User Experience: Providing more sophisticated tools for veAERO holders to analyze pool performance, track fee revenue, and optimize their voting strategies.

Deeper DeFi Integrations: Building stronger integrations with other foundational protocols on Base, such as lending markets, perpetuals exchanges, and yield aggregators, to make AERO and veAERO more integral capital assets across the ecosystem.

Cross-Chain Ambitions: As the "Superchain" vision of a network of interconnected OP Stack chains matures, there is a strong strategic rationale for Aerodrome to explore cross-chain governance and liquidity-sharing functionalities with Velodrome and other potential sister protocols.

Growth Vectors
Aerodrome's future growth is propelled by powerful tailwinds that are both internal and external to the protocol.

Growth of the Base Ecosystem: The single most significant factor for Aerodrome's success is the continued growth and adoption of the Base network itself. As the designated central liquidity hub, Aerodrome is positioned to capture a disproportionate share of the value created by new users, applications, and assets entering the ecosystem. Its close ties to Coinbase, a major onboarding ramp for new crypto users, provide an unparalleled strategic advantage in this regard.   

Expansion into New Asset Classes: The protocol has already proven its ability to serve as the primary market for core crypto assets like ETH and wrapped BTC. A major growth vector lies in its expansion into tokenized versions of real-world assets (RWAs) and foreign exchange (FX) markets. The establishment of liquid pools for assets like the Euro-backed stablecoin EURC is an early indication of this trend. As more traditional assets are brought on-chain, Aerodrome is well-positioned to become the primary venue for their trading and liquidity.   

Potential Challenges
Despite its current dominance, Aerodrome faces several long-term challenges that will require careful management by its team and its community of governors.

Sustained Competition: The DeFi space is relentlessly innovative. While Aerodrome's model is currently superior to its main competitors on Base, there is always the risk that a new DEX with a more advanced AMM design or a more compelling economic model could emerge to challenge its position.   

Sustainability of Emissions: The ve(3,3) model is heavily reliant on AERO token emissions to incentivize liquidity. The long-term success of the protocol depends on the ability of the AERO token to maintain and accrue value. If the market value of AERO were to decline significantly, the APRs for LPs would fall, potentially leading to a contraction of liquidity. The effective management of the token's inflation rate via the "Aero Fed" will be a critical test of the decentralized governance model.

Governance Centralization: As with any governance system based on token ownership, there is an inherent risk that a small number of large holders (whales, venture funds, or other protocols) could accumulate a sufficient amount of veAERO to exert outsized influence over the direction of emissions. While the current distribution is relatively widespread, maintaining a healthy degree of decentralization in voting power will be crucial for the protocol's long-term health and neutrality.

Concluding Thesis
Aerodrome Finance represents a landmark evolution in the design of automated market makers. It has successfully moved beyond the simple facilitation of token swaps to become a sophisticated engine for capital coordination and liquidity management. Its innovative ve(3,3) economic model has proven exceptionally effective at solving the incentive alignment problems that have long plagued the DeFi space, creating a virtuous cycle that rewards long-term commitment and directs capital with remarkable efficiency.

The protocol's strategic decision to fork the battle-tested Velodrome V2 codebase and launch as the native liquidity hub for the Coinbase-backed Base network has been flawlessly executed, resulting in near-immediate market dominance. Its tightly integrated flywheel, B2B service model, and symbiotic relationship with the broader Base ecosystem have created a powerful and durable competitive advantage.

The path forward will require vigilant governance to manage its monetary policy sustainably and continuous innovation to stay ahead of emerging competition. However, Aerodrome's current position is not one of a mere application on a blockchain, but of a foundational economic layer. Its long-term trajectory is inextricably tied to the success of Base itself, making it one of the most critical pieces of infrastructure in the quest to onboard the next generation of users into the world of decentralized finance.

The provided text highlights a period of explosive growth and pivotal strategic moves for Aerodrome.

1. The Coinbase Integration: A Gateway to Millions
This is the single most significant event. Aerodrome is being deeply integrated into the main Coinbase application.

Instant Distribution: Any token that launches and creates a liquidity pool on Aerodrome is now automatically available for trading to Coinbase's 100 million+ user base directly within the Coinbase app's DEX interface.

The "DeFi Mullet": This strategy is described as the "DeFi Mullet" — a simple, user-friendly frontend (Coinbase) powered by powerful, complex decentralized finance infrastructure (Aerodrome) in the backend.

Onchain Economy Rails: This move positions Aerodrome as the fundamental liquidity infrastructure for Coinbase's push to bring its massive user base "onchain." As Coinbase rolls out DEX access to more users (currently stated to be at 1-10% rollout), Aerodrome's volume and fee generation are expected to surge.

2. The "Community-First" Launch Model
Aerodrome is pioneering a new, disruptive method for token launches, moving away from traditional, often extractive, models. The launch of Syndicate's $SYND token is the prime example.


The Old Way: Projects raise money from VCs, give a large portion of their tokens to market makers, and pay expensive fees to get listed on centralized exchanges (CEXs).

The Aerodrome Way: A new project can allocate a percentage of its token supply as rewards for veAERO voters. Voters direct $AERO emissions to the new token's pool, and in return, they are among the first to receive the new token. This process allows for decentralized price discovery and seeds the initial liquidity directly within the community, bypassing costly intermediaries. This is being pitched as a more fair, transparent, and community-centric alternative.


3. Record-Breaking Performance and Market Dominance
Aerodrome isn't just a promising project; its performance metrics show it's already a dominant force.

All-Time High Revenue: The platform recently had its highest-revenue epoch ever, distributing $21 million in rewards to veAERO voters.

Volume Soars Past $250 Billion: Aerodrome has surpassed a quarter-trillion dollars in all-time trading volume, with its growth rate in 2025 being significantly faster than in previous years.

#1 on Base: It consistently captures the majority of all DEX trading volume on the Base network, making it the undisputed liquidity leader for top assets like ETH, BTC, and various Coinbase-wrapped assets (cbAssets).

4. The Center of the Base Ecosystem
Aerodrome has successfully positioned itself as the go-to platform for any project building on Base.

"The New Home Base": Numerous projects ($FLOCK, $TIG, $AUBRAI, $RSC) are migrating their protocol-owned assets to Aerodrome. They create liquidity pools on the platform to earn $AERO emissions and fees, providing a sustainable way to manage their treasuries while contributing to the ecosystem.

Launchpad for Everything: From creator coins and Real-World Assets (RWAs) to major established tokens, Aerodrome is becoming the primary venue for launching and trading on Base.

Future Vision: The "MetaDEX Revolution"
The communications from the Aerodrome team are ambitious and forward-looking.

The Endgame: They repeatedly state that their model is the "endgame" for DEXs because it maximizes value for users rather than extracting it for a team or VCs.

November 12th, 2025: They are heavily promoting a "Save the Date" for an event in New York City, suggesting major announcements and the next phase of their strategy will be unveiled then.

Disrupting Incumbents: The core belief is that by being more efficient and redistributing 100% of value, their model will outcompete and disrupt established players like Uniswap and Curve.

# Liquidity Pools

The core functionality of Aerodrome Finance is to allow users to exchange
tokens in a secure way, with low fees and low slippage.

Slippage is the difference between the current market price of a token and the
price at which the actual exchange/swap is executed. This difference could
result in a smaller amount (higher price paid) or a higher amount (smaller
price paid) of desired tokens returned from a swap.

To provide access to the best rates on the market, we identified two types of
tokens:

- correlated - for example _stable coins_ (`$USDC`, `$DAI`, etc.)
- uncorrelated - for example `$AERO` and `$BTC`

Aerodrome Finance offers two different liquidity pool types based on token pair needs, _Stable
Pools_ and _Volatile Pools_. Aerodrome supports custom factories, so that new pool types can always be integrated.

The protocol router evaluates both pool types to determine the most efficient price quotation
and trade execution route available. To protect against flashloan attacks, the router will use
30-minute TWAPs (time-weighted average prices). The router doesn't require _upkeep_ (external maintenance).

The _deeper_ the liquidity of a given pool (higher value locked), the smaller the slippage it will offer.

## Stable Pools

Stable pools are designed for tokens which have little to no
volatility. This means that the formula used for pricing the tokens allows for
low slippage even on large traded volumes.

> x³y + y³x ≥ k

## Volatile Pools

Volatile pools are designed for tokens with high price volatility.
These pools use a generic AMM formula.

> x × y ≥ k

## A visual representation of the formulas

The mathematical formulas are used to keep the total pool liquidity the same at all times.

Below, you can find a visual comparison between the stable (red) and volatile (blue)
AMM pricing equations, where:

- `x` is the amount of first token in the pool
- `y` is the amount of second token in the same pool
- `k` is a fixed constant

<SVG
  src="/svg/docs/graph-liquidity.svg"
  className="w-full max-w-full h-auto mt-4"
/>

## Concentrated Pools

Concentrated liquidity pools require the liquidity
to be deposited within a specific price range and uses ticks (equally
spaced price points) to define the range boundaries. The identifiers
for these pools reflect their tick space. These pools require
maintenance or automated liquidity management (ALM).

## Concentrated Liquidity Tick Spacing

In Velodrome's concentrated liquidity pools, the concept of **tick spacing** is used.
This refers to the minimum price movement between liquidity ranges.

Stable token pools use a price range boundary of 0.5% (tick space 50) for tokens like USDC, DAI, LUSD.

Volatile token pools use a price range boundary of 2% (tick space 200) for tokens like OP and WETH.

For highly correlated tokens like stable coins and liquid staked tokens,
a price range boundary of 0.01% (tick space 1) is available.

For emerging tokens like AERO and VELO, a price range boundary of 20% (tick space 2000)
is available to reduce liquidity pool re-balance needs.

Concentrated liquidity pools explain what they are in their symbol:

> CL1-wstETH/WETH

CL1 says that this is a concentrated pool with 1 tick spacing,
suggesting the pool token prices are closely correlated.

## Concentrated Liquidity Pool Fees

Pool swap fees are redesigned to be adjusted independently from the pool type.
Fees can now reflect partner protocols needs and can be adjusted based on the market's volatility.
To reduce operational overhead, we are working on a dynamic fee module that will adjust itself on demand.

## Calculating APRs

The Annual Percentage Rate (APR) for liquidity pools in Aerodrome is calculated
differently for basic and concentrated pools.

For basic pools, the APR is calculated using the total staked liquidity.

For concentrated pools, the APR is calculated using the total staked liquidity
within the pool current price range (active tick) and the surrounding (above and below)
price ranges (+/-1 tick from current tick).


# Relay

Relay was designed to automate the process of managing veNFTs:

- users deposit their veNFTs into the available Relay strategy
- all the voting and claiming is optimally done by the strategy automation
- rewards are converted into the strategy asset or compounded back increasing
  the deposited veNFT balance, all as part of the automation!

{
<div className="text-amber bg-amber/10 p-4 rounded-xl">
  Depositing into a strategy will extend your veNFT unlock date to maximum!
</div>
}

Withdrawal of the veNFTs is possible only after the first week. Please make
sure the automation was run before you withdraw, the latest update date
should be recent.

### Compounders

Compounding strategies are designed to claim all the rebase and the voting
rewards. The rewards are converted and locked back into the veNFT balances.

This strategy was designed for users who want to increase their voting power!

### Convertors

Convertor strategies are designed to claim all the rebases and the voting
rewards. While the rebases are compounded back into the veNFTs, the rewards
are converted into the strategy asset (eg. USDC, OP, ETH) and are shown
for every depositor when available for claiming.

### Relays run by the Protocol

The **veAERO MAXI** Relay is a compounder strategy that does the following:

- Votes to optimally achieve the maximum rewards available
- Claims the rebase
- Claims & converts rewards into Aero
- Locks all converted Aero increasing the locked amount of those who deposited into the Relay

### Relays run by or for the Protocol Partners

These Relay strategies are either run by or for the protocol partners,
usually other protocols with the goal of supporting the partner liquidity pools.

These strategies generally vote to support their own liquidity and
thus those who deposit into those pools.

In comparison to the veAERO Maxi, these relays will likely achieve smaller rewards,
but more consistent rewards for their pools.

Partner protocols can request a Relay strategy, this will soon require an open governance
proposal to be voted and passed by the veAERO voters.

Compounder strategy:

- Votes on the partners chosen pool to direct emissions
- Claims the rebase
- Claims & converts rewards into Aero
- Locks all converted Aero increasing the locked amount of the partners veNFT Relay position

### Architecture

The strategies are simple smart contracts that operate a specially managed
veNFT, also known as (m)veNFT.

The (m)veNFTs can be minted or deactivated by the protocol Governor and carry
no voting power initially, instead, these aggregate the voting power of any
regular deposited veNFTs. Once withdrawn, the regular veNFTs receive a share of
the aggregated voting power and the unlock date is set to maximum.

Owners of these (m)veNFTs can vote, claim rebases and collect rewards. That is
why these are usually granted to protocols or managers of the Relay strategies.

In case of an issue with one of the (m)veNFTs, these get deactivated and the
depositors will have to withdraw safely their veNFTs.

Relay was designed to solve the partner protocol needs and provide a flexible
way to build strategies on top of (m)veNFTs. Relay strategies are automated and
operated by a decentralized network, with the exception of the voting, which is
handled by the (m)veNFT managers.

### Governance

The depositors are still able to exercise their governance voting power. The
Governor will report the up-to-date locked amount of the veNFTs managed by a
Relay strategy.

# Voting

$veAERO holders decide which liquidity pools receive $AERO emissions. In return, voters receive 100% of the trading fees and bribes collected from the liquidity pool they vote for.

## Instructions

Distribute 100% of your Lock's (veNFT) vote-power among your preferred pools and Cast your vote. Repeat for each of your Locks (veNFTs). Unallocated vote-power (if {'<'} 100%) will be split proportionally among the selected pools. Each Lock (veNFT) can only cast votes once per epoch.

If you increased your Lock's (veNFT) balance during the epoch, recast your vote to allocate your vote-power in full. Unchanged votes carry over into the next epoch.

## Timeline

Votes for the next epoch, are due by Wednesday at 23:00 UTC, 1 hour before next epoch begins. During the following two hours, no voting operations will take place as this time is reserved for protocol operations/automations.

## Rewards

Voting rewards for a given epoch will appear in your Dashboard after the epoch change on Thursday at 00:00 UTC. Rebase rewards for new locks will appear after the second epoch change.

import SVG from "react-inlinesvg";

# Voter Rewards

## Fees

Token pairs capture fees from the volume enabled by the liquidity in each pool.

The fees collected by staked LPs the previous epoch are deposited as incentives
for the current voting epoch.

Fee rewards are distributed in the same tokens as the liquidity pool tokens
these originate from (e.g., if the pool is `vAMM-AERO/USDC` the distributed
tokens are `$AERO` and `$USDC`).

Fee rewards are distributed as accrued and can be claimed at any time. Fee rewards deposited as voter incentives are available for claim after the epoch changes (Thursday 00:00 UTC), and are distributed proportionally to the voting power cast by a voter (`$veAERO`).

## Incentives

In addition to fee rewards, liquidity pools can receive external voter rewards from protocols or other participants (known as _incentives_). Incentives can be deposited for _whitelisted_ tokens and are distributed _only_ to voters on that pool, proportionally to their share of pool votes.

These rewards are available for claim after the epoch changes (Thursday 00:00 UTC), and are distributed proportionally to the voting power cast by a voter (`$veAERO`).

## Rewards claim

Rebase rewards are claimable after a new epoch has started (Thursday 00:00 UTC).

An example of incentives, voting, and rewards claim timeline:

- A new epoch starts Thursday (00:00 UTC)
- Incentives are deposited at any point in the epoch
- Voters vote for their preferred pools
- Once the next epoch arrives (the following Thursday), users are able to claim rewards

Has Aerodrome Finance Become the Leading DeFi Protocol on Base?
Updated On 25 August 2025

DeFi

Has Aerodrome Finance Become the Leading DeFi Protocol on Base?
With each new market cycle, Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols face a critical test: adapt to changing priorities or risk being left behind. In the current cycle, the focus within DeFi has shifted from short-term yield farming toward sustainable yield optimization, greater capital efficiency, and infrastructure designed to attract institutional participation. Within this evolving landscape, Aerodrome Finance ($AERO), a leading decentralized exchange (DEX) of the Base blockchain ecosystem, has distinguished itself through rapid growth and technical innovation, raising the question: could it become one of the standout protocols defining this cycle of DeFi?

DWF Ventures shares a deep dive analysis of this project as a defining protocol of this cycle.

Introduction
Launched on Base in August 2023, Aerodrome is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built on an Automated Market Maker (AMM) framework and powered by a ve(3,3) tokenomics model. This design combines the benefits of continuous liquidity provision with long-term incentive alignment. Through its vote-escrow (ve) mechanism, users can lock the native $AERO token to receive veAERO, granting them governance rights, a share of protocol fees, and the ability to direct liquidity incentives toward specific pools. This structure creates a competitive environment where protocols and liquidity providers vie for voting power, resulting in deep, sustainable liquidity. 

Since its launch, Aerodrome has cemented itself as the leading DEX on one of the fastest-growing Layer 2 networks, capturing close to 50% of total DEX volume on Base, with all-time trading volume close to surpassing $250 billion. This base of stable liquidity and growing market share is reflected in Aerodrome’s current on-chain metrics.

Aerodrome Current Metrics: TVL, Trading Volume, and Revenue Performance
As of August 2025, Aerodrome Finance holds approximately $602 million in Total Value Locked (TVL), entirely on Base, underscoring its position as the chain’s primary liquidity hub. This capital supports one of the most active decentralized exchanges in the ecosystem, with daily trading volumes averaging around $810 million. Such activity translates into annualized swap revenue of roughly $202 million, about $550,000 per day, ranking Aerodrome among the highest-revenue DEXs in DeFi.

Over the last 30 days alone (July 23–August 22, 2025), Aerodrome has processed $21.85 billion in trading volume, bringing its cumulative all-time volume close to $238 billion. Aerodrome’s growth not only reflects the expansion of the Base network but also highlights the protocol’s ability to consistently capture order flow and generate sustainable revenue in an increasingly competitive DeFi landscape.

Protocol Upgrades
Protocol Upgrades
Aerodrome’s ability to maintain its position as the leading DEX on Base stems from a series of upgrades that have strengthened its infrastructure and user experience. These include:

Flashblocks introduced a substantial technical enhancement, delivering up to 10x faster execution speeds, tighter pricing, and improved capital efficiency for traders and liquidity providers. 
ALM V2, an advanced liquidity management system, further optimized how liquidity is deployed, improving pool performance, bolstering security, and streamlining reward distribution, making it easier for Liquidity Providers (LPs) to earn effectively without manual adjustments.
In addition, integration with Coinbase’s DEX interface has made Aerodrome directly accessible to one of the largest user bases in crypto, lowering barriers to on-chain trading and encouraging broader adoption. 
Finally, an upcoming feature, the Pool Launcher Tool, will introduce permissionless pool creation, enabling projects of any size to deploy and manage liquidity pools efficiently. Once live, this tool is expected to broaden access to Aerodrome’s trading infrastructure and encourage more teams to build on Base, further establishing Aerodrome as the network’s core liquidity hub.
These upgrades and integrations have translated into tangible results, especially when Aerodrome’s performance is compared to other leading decentralized exchanges.

Aerodrome Performance Compared to Competitors
Aerodrome’s recent performance highlights its ability to achieve significant results with comparatively fewer resources, setting it apart from other leading decentralized exchanges. In the seven days leading up to August 22, 2025, the protocol generated approximately $4.6 million in revenue, exceeding the combined revenue of PancakeSwap, Meteora, and Pump.fun, despite each of these platforms maintaining a higher Total Value Locked (TVL). This revenue strength demonstrates Aerodrome’s ability to efficiently convert crypto liquidity into protocol earnings.

Trading activity highlights Aerodrome’s strength relative to other leading DEXs. Daily volumes on Aerodrome now exceed $950 million, placing it ahead of every other decentralized exchange on Base. Over the past seven days (August 14–21, 2025), Aerodrome generated approximately $4.6 million in fees, outpacing both Curve Finance and PancakeSwap despite operating with less than one-third of their TVL.

Capital efficiency further distinguishes Aerodrome from its peers. It achieved nearly twice the trading volume of Uniswap’s top pool while using roughly half the amount of TVL. For liquidity providers, this means higher productivity of their assets, while for the protocol, it enables competitive trading conditions without requiring massive capital reserves.

Altogether, these figures highlight how effective Aerodrome’s recent improvements have been in driving growth and how successfully the team has capitalized on them.

This strong competitive position is supported by Aerodrome’s underlying tokenomics, which are designed to continuously align incentives and drive sustained growth.

Flywheel Mechanics: How Aerodrome Aligns Stakeholders
Aerodrome’s ve(3,3) model creates a self-reinforcing cycle that benefits token holders, liquidity providers, and protocols.

Users lock $AERO to receive veAERO, a vote-escrowed NFT granting governance rights, a share of protocol fees, and voting power over where new $AERO emissions are directed. External projects can offer incentives to veAERO holders to secure votes for their pools, ensuring deeper liquidity. Liquidity providers in these pools earn trading fees, $AERO emissions, and potential bribes, making participation attractive.

This system aligns incentives across all participants: locked tokens increase voting power, voting directs rewards to active pools, and greater liquidity drives higher volume and fees, fueling the cycle further. The result is a sustainable feedback loop that supports Aerodrome’s long-term growth.

While Aerodrome’s tokenomics provide a strong internal growth engine, external factors have also played a key role, most notably its integration with Coinbase. 

Coinbase Integration
Another strong reason for Aerodrome’s recent growth has been Coinbase’s integration of the DEX into its main application. This development connects Aerodrome directly to one of the world’s largest retail and institutional crypto user bases, enabling Coinbase customers to trade on Aerodrome seamlessly from within the app. By removing the need for separate wallets or third-party interfaces, the integration lowers barriers to entry for on-chain trading and introduces a broader audience to DeFi on Base.

Coinbase has further strengthened this integration by offering feeless trading on Aerodrome through Coinbase One, its premium subscription service. This initiative incentivizes more users to interact with Aerodrome’s liquidity pools, boosting trading activity and liquidity depth.

Looking forward, Coinbase’s strategy to expand wrapped assets, such as $cbSOL and $cbSUI, could significantly increase the range of assets available on Base. As the leading DEX on the network, Aerodrome stands to benefit from this influx of liquidity and trading volume, positioning it as a primary venue for both retail and institutional flows within the Base ecosystem.

Institutional Exposure: Aerodrome’s Role in Base’s Growth
As the leading DEX on Base, Aerodrome is positioned to benefit from the network’s increasing institutional adoption. Base’s infrastructure, backed by Coinbase and aligned with U.S. regulatory standards, has attracted interest from major players such as J.P. Morgan and is emerging as a gateway for “Compliant DeFi”, on-chain markets accessible to regulated entities.

In this environment, Aerodrome functions as Base’s primary liquidity hub, providing the depth and efficiency needed to support institutional activity. As adoption of Base expands, Aerodrome is likely to play a central role in facilitating and scaling this influx of capital.

Conclusion
While Aerodrome Finance has already achieved remarkable growth, multiple factors suggest this trajectory is far from over. Its ve(3,3) Flywheel model continues to drive value to token holders, liquidity providers, and protocols alike; its high capital efficiency enables it to compete with and outperform larger peers; and its integration with Coinbase opens the door to mainstream and institutional adoption on Base. Together, these elements position Aerodrome as one of the defining DeFi protocols of this cycle.

The DWF Ventures team sees Aerodrome’s progress as a reflection of the broader potential of the Base ecosystem, actively supporting projects building innovative, high-impact solutions in this space.

Aerodrome Finance is the leading decentralized exchange on Base, Coinbase’s Layer-2 network, offering token swaps, liquidity provision, and governance powered by the AERO token and its vote-escrowed version, veAERO. With Velodrome V2 tech, emissions-based incentives, and a robust reward structure—including bribes and protocol fee sharing—Aerodrome plays a central role in building deep, sustainable liquidity for the entire Base DeFi ecosystem.

Curious about Aerodrome Finance but not sure where to start? You're not alone. This DeFi protocol has been gaining significant attention among Base network users, and for good reason. Let's break down what Aerodrome Finance is, how it works, and why it matters in the expanding Base blockchain ecosystem.

Understanding Aerodrome Finance Basics
Aerodrome Finance is a decentralized exchange (DEX) built specifically for the Base network. Launched in August 2023, it functions as the primary liquidity hub for Base, Coinbase's layer-2 blockchain solution.

Key point: Aerodrome isn't just another DEX – it's designed to be the central infrastructure for liquidity on Base, similar to what Velodrome is for the Optimism network.

At its core, Aerodrome is built on Velodrome V2 technology, making it essentially the "Velodrome of Base." This connection isn't coincidental – both protocols share the same development team and underlying technology, but serve different networks.

The AERO Token Explained
The native token of the platform is AERO, which serves several important functions:

Governance rights: When locked as veAERO
Voting power: For directing liquidity incentives
Value accrual: Through protocol fees
Liquidity incentives: Distributed to liquidity providers
AERO has a maximum supply of 100 million tokens, with a distribution model designed to incentivize long-term participation in the ecosystem.

How AERO tokens are distributed:

20% allocated to the team and investors
5% for early liquidity mining
75% distributed through ongoing emissions
Token emissions follow an epoch-based rewards system, with approximately 2 million AERO distributed weekly in the initial phase, gradually decreasing over time.

veAERO Governance: The Power Behind Aerodrome
When users lock their AERO tokens, they receive veAERO (vote-escrowed AERO) in return. This mechanism is central to Aerodrome's governance model.

What makes veAERO special:

Longer lock periods (up to 4 years) grant more veAERO per AERO locked
veAERO holders vote on which liquidity pools receive AERO emissions
veAERO balances decay over time, encouraging active governance
Holders earn a share of protocol fees (currently 25% of all swap fees)
This model creates alignment between governance participants and the protocol's long-term health. By directing emissions to valuable trading pairs, veAERO holders can significantly influence where liquidity flows within the Base ecosystem.

How Aerodrome Works as an AMM
As an Automated Market Maker (AMM), Aerodrome allows users to trade tokens without traditional order books. Instead, it uses liquidity pools where assets are pre-funded.

Aerodrome offers two types of pools:

Classic pools: Traditional constant product pools (similar to Uniswap V2)
Stable pools: Optimized for trading between assets that should maintain similar prices
What sets Aerodrome apart from many other DEXs is its direct integration of liquidity incentives into its core design. The protocol uses "bribes" and vote-directed emissions to create a self-sustaining liquidity ecosystem.

Liquidity Provider Incentives: The Reward Structure
Providing liquidity on Aerodrome can be rewarding, but it's important to understand the different ways you can earn:

Trading fees: LPs earn a portion of the 0.25% fee charged on all swaps
AERO emissions: Receive AERO tokens based on veAERO voting
Bribes: External protocols can offer rewards to veAERO voters for directing emissions to their pools
This multi-layered incentive structure creates what some call a "flywheel effect" – more liquidity leads to more trading, which increases fees and attracts more liquidity providers.

Important note: While providing liquidity can be profitable, it comes with risks including impermanent loss. Do your own research before committing funds.

Aerodrome's Role in the Base Ecosystem
As the primary liquidity hub for Base, Aerodrome plays a crucial role in the broader DeFi ecosystem on this emerging network.

Base, being backed by Coinbase, has attracted significant attention and capital since its launch. Aerodrome provides the infrastructure needed for other protocols to establish liquid markets for their tokens.

By consolidating liquidity in one major DEX rather than fragmenting it across multiple platforms, Aerodrome helps create deeper markets and better trading experiences for all Base users.

Frequently Asked Questions
How does Aerodrome Finance work?
Aerodrome works as an AMM where users can swap tokens, provide liquidity, and earn rewards. Its unique feature is the veAERO governance system that directs liquidity incentives to different pools based on voter preferences.

What is the AERO token used for?
AERO can be locked to receive veAERO, which grants governance rights, voting power for directing incentives, and a share of protocol fees. The token forms the backbone of the platform's incentive structure.

What is the relationship between Aerodrome and Velodrome?
Aerodrome is built on Velodrome V2 technology and shares the same development team. Essentially, Aerodrome is to Base what Velodrome is to Optimism – the primary liquidity hub for its respective network.

How do I earn rewards on Aerodrome Finance?
You can earn rewards by providing liquidity to pools, locking AERO for veAERO to receive protocol fees, or receiving bribes for directing your veAERO votes toward specific pools.

What is veAERO and how does it differ from AERO?
veAERO is what you get when you lock AERO tokens. Unlike AERO, veAERO grants voting rights and a share of protocol fees. The amount of veAERO you receive depends on how long you lock your AERO (up to 4 years).

When was Aerodrome Finance launched?
Aerodrome Finance launched in August 2023 alongside the Base network's public release.

Final Thoughts
Aerodrome Finance represents an important piece of infrastructure for the growing Base blockchain ecosystem. Its thoughtful tokenomics, governance model, and liquidity incentives create a solid foundation for DeFi activities on Base.

Whether you're looking to trade, provide liquidity, or participate in governance, understanding how Aerodrome works is becoming increasingly important for anyone interested in the Base ecosystem.

Remember that while DeFi protocols like Aerodrome offer exciting opportunities, they also come with risks. Always conduct thorough research and consider your risk tolerance before participating.

Aerodrome Finance
Aerodrome Finance is a decentralized exchange on the Base network that integrates multiple automated market maker models into a unified platform. It is a central hub for trading, liquidity provisioning, and governance within the Base ecosystem. [5]

Overview
Aerodrome Finance is a decentralized exchange on the Base blockchain launched on August 28, 2023. It combines features from various AMM models—including Uniswap V2 and V3, Curve, and Convex—to serve as the primary liquidity hub for Base. The platform enables token swaps, generates trading fees, and incentivizes liquidity provision through AERO token emissions. Users can lock AERO to receive veAERO, which grants governance rights and a share of protocol fees.

Developed by the creators of Velodrome on Optimism, Aerodrome builds on elements of the Solidly protocol and applies them to Base, an Ethereum Layer 2. Without a native Base token, AERO is the main incentive and governance asset. Coinbase Ventures participates in the protocol by locking AERO tokens and voting on emissions, reinforcing Aerodrome’s strategic role within the Base ecosystem. [6]

Features
Flight School
Flight School is a recurring incentive program on Aerodrome Finance that distributes bonus veAERO to users who create new token locks. To qualify, a user must lock at least 2,500 veAERO during four weeks, referred to as a "class." At the end of each class, bonus distribution is proportional to each participant's share of the total qualifying veAERO. Coinbase One members receive a 1.3x weighting on their locks for bonus calculations. Since its launch, the program has distributed over 42.6 million AERO in veAERO form. [7]

AERO Fed
The AERO Fed is a governance mechanism on Aerodrome Finance that allows veAERO holders to influence the emission rate of AERO tokens. Initially, AERO emissions followed a fixed schedule, decreasing by 1% each week. Starting at epoch 67 (December 4, 2024), this system transitioned to a smart contract-controlled process, enabling veAERO voters to adjust emissions weekly by increasing, decreasing, or maintaining the current rate within set limits.

The AERO Fed aims to align emissions policy with market conditions and ecosystem needs. Emissions can range from a maximum of 1% of total supply per week (52% annualized) to a minimum of 0.01% (0.52% annualized). During the initial implementation phase, emissions are automatically reduced while the community becomes familiar with the new system. Once the transition ends, veAERO holders will take full control of emission adjustments through on-chain voting. [8]

Slipstream
Slipstream is Aerodrome’s custom implementation of concentrated liquidity pools, designed to improve capital efficiency and trading execution on the Base network. It offers up to 10 times higher trading volume per unit of TVL than standard clAMM pools, using customizable tick spacing, optimized fees, and a tailored fee algorithm. As its share of Base trading volume grows, veAERO voters benefit from increased fee rewards, reinforcing Aerodrome's liquidity incentives. [9]

AERO

The AERO token is an ERC-20 asset that rewards liquidity providers on Aerodrome Finance. While it can be traded or used in liquidity pools, its main function is to be locked for governance participation and incentive alignment. All tokens held by the Aerodrome Foundation are locked, with no liquid vesting allocations for contributors or team members, placing them on equal footing with other participants in the system. [2] [10]

veAERO
veAERO is an ERC-721 non-fungible token representing locked AERO tokens for governance purposes on Aerodrome Finance. Users can lock AERO for up to four years to receive veAERO, with voting power increasing linearly based on the length of the lock period. For example, 100 AERO locked for four years equals 100 veAERO, while the same amount locked for one year yields 25 veAERO. Additional AERO can be added to an existing veAERO NFT, and these tokens are used to participate in governance decisions. [10]

Tokenomics
AERO and veAERO have the following allocation: [10]

veVELO Lockers airdrop: 40%
Public Goods Fund: 21%
Foundation: 19%
Flight School: 10%
Voter Incentives: 8%
Genesis Liquidity Incentives: 2%
Funding
In February 2024, Aerodrome Finance received an investment from the Base Ecosystem Fund, a program led by CB Ventures to support on-chain projects within the Base network. While the amount was not disclosed, the investment signaled strategic backing for Aerodrome, which held a 30% market share on Base and over $132 million in total value locked at the time, according to DeFiLlama. The fund had previously supported other Base-based projects such as Avantis, BSX, Onboard, and Truflation. Aerodrome described the investment as a step toward deeper collaboration in advancing Base’s infrastructure and liquidity ecosystem. [3] [4]

00:10 - 00:12: Camila Russo: I'm your host, Camila Russo.
00:12 - 00:15: Camila Russo: Today I have Alex Cutler, co-founder of Aerodrome Finance.
00:15 - 00:17: Camila Russo: Alex, thanks so much for joining me.
00:17 - 00:38: Camila Russo: Yeah, that was a super interesting point. Before we jump into the next question, I just wanted to ask you, why do you think these new projects on Base are attracting so much liquidity and so much usage?
00:38 - 00:41: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. Thanks for having me on.
00041 - 00:46: Alexander Cutler: I mean, I think it's a few things.
00:46 - 00:50: Alexander Cutler: So, you know, first and foremost, I think Base has done an amazing job positioning themselves as, you know, this kind of new neutral chain for Web3.
00:50 - 01:03: Alexander Cutler: They've done a really, really good job of saying, like, hey, we're not going to be like an OP chain or an Arbitrum chain, where, you know, they're really heavily focused on the Ethereum ecosystem and building up that.
01:03 - 01:08: Alexander Cutler: They're really focused on, like, a new set of users that they can bring into the ecosystem that have nothing to do with crypto itself.
01:08 - 01:13: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's super important, just like from a marketing perspective.
01:13 - 01:19: Alexander Cutler: I think what they've done with friend.tech, what they've done with some of these other things, have really attracted a lot of new users who like, you know, a lot of them don't even know that they're interacting with crypto.
01:19 - 01:23: Alexander Cutler: They just know that it's just this new cool thing that they're using to trade influence or whatever.
01:23 - 01:27: Alexander Cutler: And so I think that's super important just for like new user onboarding.
01:27 - 01:34: Alexander Cutler: And also just like when you're thinking about a new chain, what the primary difference is between, like, say, Base and Polygon or an Arbitrum or Optimism, is that it's a new ecosystem.
01:34 - 01:39: Alexander Cutler: So when you're looking at something like an Arbitrum or an Optimism, like the vast majority of the liquidity and the developers that are building on there.
01:39 - 01:43: Alexander Cutler: They're all very Ethereum centric, they're all coming from Ethereum.
01:43 - 01:49: Alexander Cutler: And so, you know, what that means is that the liquidity, it's just really fragmented and it's all just kind of like the same liquidity just moving around between different chains.
01:49 - 1:53: Alexander Cutler: When you look at Base, what we're seeing is that a lot of the liquidity is actually new to crypto.
01:53 - 1:59: Alexander Cutler: So it's not just the same users with the same capital that are moving around between chains.
1:59 - 2:04: Alexander Cutler: It's actually attracting new users into the ecosystem because the applications that are building on there are just attracting them in from all sorts of different vectors.
2:04 - 2:09: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's something really special and what makes Base such a like a unique place to build on.
2:09 - 2:13: Alexander Cutler: And then secondly, just from a developer perspective, they've done an excellent job of just making it very easy to build on there.
2:13 - 2:18: Alexander Cutler: And also like, I think another big thing that they've really leaned into is building on there.
2:18 - 2:23: Alexander Cutler: There's not this like super high tax of like, hey, we're an Arbitrum, we're an Optimism, like, you're going to pay us 10% of your tokens for just existing on our chain.
2:23 - 2:28: Alexander Cutler: They're trying to be much more neutral in a sense and say, hey, like, we want you to succeed.
2:28 - 2:32: Alexander Cutler: We want you to like thrive, we want you to, like, bring new users into the ecosystem.
2:32 - 2:37: Alexander Cutler: And we're not going to like try to tax you out the wazoo or like, try to pull, like, any type of economic rent just for you existing.
2:37 - 2:42: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's another big differentiator that has made Base successful for attracting both users and developers.
2:42 - 2:48: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think it's a few things.
2:48 - 2:54: Alexander Cutler: So, you know, first and foremost, I think Base has done an amazing job positioning themselves as, you know, this kind of new neutral chain for Web3.
2:54 - 3:00: Alexander Cutler: They've done a really, really good job of saying, like, hey, we're not going to be like an OP chain or an Arbitrum chain, where, you know, they're really heavily focused on the Ethereum ecosystem and building up that.
3:00 - 3:05: Alexander Cutler: They're really focused on, like, a new set of users that they can bring into the ecosystem that have nothing to do with crypto itself.
3:05 - 3:07: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's super important, just like from a marketing perspective.

3:12 - 3:16: Alexander Cutler: They just know that it's just this new cool thing that they're using to trade influence or whatever.
3:16 - 3:21: Alexander Cutler: And so I think that's super important just for like new user onboarding.
3:21 - 3:27: Alexander Cutler: And also just like when you're thinking about a new chain, what the primary difference is between, like, say, Base and Polygon or an Arbitrum or Optimism, is that it's a new ecosystem.
3:27 - 3:34: Alexander Cutler: So when you're looking at something like an Arbitrum or an Optimism, like the vast majority of the liquidity and the developers that are building on there.
3:34 - 3:40: Alexander Cutler: They're all very Ethereum centric, they're all coming from Ethereum.
3:40 - 3:45: Alexander Cutler: And so, you know, what that means is that the liquidity, it's just really fragmented and it's all just kind of like the same liquidity just moving around between different chains.
3:45 - 3:51: Alexander Cutler: When you look at Base, what we're seeing is that a lot of the liquidity is actually new to crypto.
3:51 - 3:56: Alexander Cutler: So it's not just the same users with the same capital that are moving around between chains.
3:56 - 4:02: Alexander Cutler: It's actually attracting new users into the ecosystem because the applications that are building on there are just attracting them in from all sorts of different vectors.
4:02 - 4:06: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's something really special and what makes Base such a like a unique place to build on.
4:06 - 4:10: Alexander Cutler: And then secondly, just from a developer perspective, they've done an excellent job of just making it very easy to build on there.

4:17 - 4:22: Alexander Cutler: There's not this like super high tax of like, hey, we're an Arbitrum, we're an Optimism, like, you're going to pay us 10% of your tokens for just existing on our chain.
4:22 - 4:27: Alexander Cutler: They're trying to be much more neutral in a sense and say, hey, like, we want you to succeed.
4:27 - 4:32: Alexander Cutler: We want you to like thrive, we want you to, like, bring new users into the ecosystem.
4:32 - 4:38: Alexander Cutler: And we're not going to like try to tax you out the wazoo or like, try to pull, like, any type of economic rent just for you existing.
4:38 - 4:44: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's another big differentiator that has made Base successful for attracting both users and developers.
4:44 - 4:49: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think it's a few things.
4:49 - 4:54: Alexander Cutler: So, you know, first and foremost, I think Base has done an amazing job positioning themselves as, you know, this kind of new neutral chain for Web3.

5:21 - 5:24: Camila Russo: And also just like when you're thinking about a new chain, what the primary difference is between, like, say, Base and Polygon or an Arbitrum or Optimism, is that it's a new ecosystem.
5:24 - 5:29: Alexander Cutler: So when you're looking at something like an Arbitrum or an Optimism, like the vast majority of the liquidity and the developers that are building on there.
5:29 - 5:35: Alexander Cutler: They're all very Ethereum centric, they're all coming from Ethereum.
5:35 - 5:40: Alexander Cutler: And so, you know, what that means is that the liquidity, it's just really fragmented and it's all just kind of like the same liquidity just moving around between different chains.
5:40 - 5:46: Alexander Cutler: When you look at Base, what we're seeing is that a lot of the liquidity is actually new to crypto.
5:46 - 5:52: Alexander Cutler: So it's not just the same users with the same capital that are moving around between chains.
5:52 - 5:57: Alexander Cutler: It's actually attracting new users into the ecosystem because the applications that are building on there are just attracting them in from all sorts of different vectors.
55:57 - 6:01: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's something really special and what makes Base such a like a unique place to build on.
6:01 - 6:06: Alexander Cutler: And then secondly, just from a developer perspective, they've done an excellent job of just making it very easy to build on there.
6:06 - 6:12: Alexander Cutler: And also like, I think another big thing that they've really leaned into is building on there.
6:12 - 6:18: Alexander Cutler: There's not this like super high tax of like, hey, we're an Arbitrum, we're an Optimism, like, you're going to pay us 10% of your tokens for just existing on our chain.
6:18 - 6:23: Alexander Cutler: They're trying to be much more neutral in a sense and say, hey, like, we want you to succeed.
6:23 - 6:28: Alexander Cutler: We want you to like thrive, we want you to, like, bring new users into the ecosystem.
6:28 - 6:33: Alexander Cutler: And we're not going to like try to tax you out the wazoo or like, try to pull, like, any type of economic rent just for you existing.
6:33 - 6:39: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's another big differentiator that has made Base successful for attracting both users and developers.
6:39 - 6:44: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think it's a few things.
6:44 - 6:49: Alexander Cutler: So, you know, first and foremost, I think Base has done an amazing job positioning themselves as, you know, this kind of new neutral chain for Web3.
6:49 - 6:54: Alexander Cutler: They've done a really, really good job of saying, like, hey, we're not going to be like an OP chain or an Arbitrum chain, where, you know, they're really heavily focused on the Ethereum ecosystem and building up that.
6:54 - 7:01: Alexander Cutler: They're really focused on, like, a new set of users that they can bring into the ecosystem that have nothing to do with crypto itself.
7:01 - 7:06: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's super important, just like from a marketing perspective.
7:06 - 7:11: Alexander Cutler: I think what they've done with friend.tech, what they've done with some of these other things, have really attracted a lot of new users who like, you know, a lot of them don't even know that they're interacting with crypto.
7:11 - 7:16: Alexander Cutler: They just know that it's just this new cool thing that they're using to trade influence or whatever.
7:16 - 7:21: Alexander Cutler: And so I think that's super important just for like new user onboarding.
7:21 - 7:26: Alexander Cutler: And also just like when you're thinking about a new chain, what the primary difference is between, like, say, Base and Polygon or an Arbitrum or Optimism, is that it's a new ecosystem.

7:44 - 7:50: Alexander Cutler: When you look at Base, what we're seeing is that a lot of the liquidity is actually new to crypto.
7:50 - 7:55: Alexander Cutler: So it's not just the same users with the same capital that are moving around between chains.
7:55 - 8:01: Alexander Cutler: It's actually attracting new users into the ecosystem because the applications that are building on there are just attracting them in from all sorts of different vectors.
8:01 - 8:05: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's something really special and what makes Base such a like a unique place to build on.
8:05 - 8:11: Alexander Cutler: And then secondly, just from a developer perspective, they've done an excellent job of just making it very easy to build on there.
8:11 - 8:17: Alexander Cutler: And also like, I think another big thing that they've really leaned into is building on there.
8:17 - 8:23: Alexander Cutler: There's not this like super high tax of like, hey, we're an Arbitrum, we're an Optimism, like, you're going to pay us 10% of your tokens for just existing on our chain.
8:23 - 8:28: Alexander Cutler: They're trying to be much more neutral in a sense and say, hey, like, we want you to succeed.
8:28 - 8:33: Camila Russo: That's super interesting because you also have Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and then Base come in.
8:33 - 8:37: Camila Russo: And it's not just attracting the same liquidity that's rotating between chains.
8:37 - 8:40: Camila Russo: You're saying it's bringing completely new users, which is the holy grail.
8:40 - 8:44: Camila Russo: That's what everyone wants, to bring new people into the crypto ecosystem.
8:44 - 8:48: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think it's a few things.
8:48 - 8:53: Alexander Cutler: So, you know, first and foremost, I think Base has done an amazing job positioning themselves as, you know, this kind of new neutral chain for Web3.

8:58 - 9:03: Alexander Cutler: They're really focused on, like, a new set of users that they can bring into the ecosystem that have nothing to do with crypto itself.
9:03 - 9:07: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's super important, just like from a marketing perspective.
9:07 - 9:12: Alexander Cutler: I think what they've done with friend.tech, what they've done with some of these other things, have really attracted a lot of new users who like, you know, a lot of them don't even know that they're interacting with crypto.

9:49 - 9:55: Alexander Cutler: So it's not just the same users with the same capital that are moving around between chains.
9:55 - 10:00: Alexander Cutler: It's actually attracting new users into the ecosystem because the applications that are building on there are just attracting them in from all sorts of different vectors.
10:00 - 10:04: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's something really special and what makes Base such a like a unique place to build on.

10:34 - 10:49: Camila Russo: This is like the holy grail. Yes, so I'm I mean, that's why this is so interesting is that you also have Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and then Base come in and it's not just attracting the same liquidity that's rotating between chains.
10:49 - 10:52: Camila Russo: You're saying it's bringing completely new users, which is the holy grail.

19:48 - 19:53: Alexander Cutler: When you look at Base, what we're seeing is that a lot of the liquidity is actually new to crypto.
19:53 - 19:59: Alexander Cutler: So it's not just the same users with the same capital that are moving around between chains.
19:59 - 20:04: Alexander Cutler: It's actually attracting new users into the ecosystem because the applications that are building on there are just attracting them in from all sorts of different vectors.
20:04 - 20:08: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's something really special and what makes Base such a like a unique place to build on.
20:08 - 20:14: Alexander Cutler: And then secondly, just from a developer perspective, they've done an excellent job of just making it very easy to build on there.
20:14 - 20:19: Alexander Cutler: And also like, I think another big thing that they've really leaned into is building on there.
20:19 - 20:25: Alexander Cutler: There's not this like super high tax of like, hey, we're an Arbitrum, we're an Optimism, like, you're going to pay us 10% of your tokens for just existing on our chain.
20:25 - 20:30: Alexander Cutler: They're trying to be much more neutral in a sense and say, hey, like, we want you to succeed.
20:30 - 20:35: Alexander Cutler: We want you to like thrive, we want you to, like, bring new users into the ecosystem.
20:35 - 20:41: Alexander Cutler: And we're not going to like try to tax you out the wazoo or like, try to pull, like, any type of economic rent just for you existing.
20:41 - 20:46: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's another big differentiator that has made Base successful for attracting both users and developers.
20:46 - 20:52: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think it's a few things.
20:52 - 20:57: Alexander Cutler: So, you know, first and foremost, I think Base has done an amazing job positioning themselves as, you know, this kind of new neutral chain for Web3.
20:57 - 21:02: Alexander Cutler: They've done a really, really good job of saying, like, hey, we're not going to be like an OP chain or an Arbitrum chain, where, you know, they're really heavily focused on the Ethereum ecosystem and building up that.
21:02 - 21:08: Alexander Cutler: They're really focused on, like, a new set of users that they can bring into the ecosystem that have nothing to do with crypto itself.
21:08 - 21:12: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's super important, just like from a marketing perspective.
21:12 - 21:17: Alexander Cutler: I think what they've done with friend.tech, what they've done with some of these other things, have really attracted a lot of new users who like, you know, a lot of them don't even know that they're interacting with crypto.
21:17 - 21:22: Alexander Cutler: They just know that it's just this new cool thing that they're using to trade influence or whatever.
21:22 - 21:27: Alexander Cutler: And so I think that's super important just for like new user onboarding.
21:27 - 21:32: Alexander Cutler: And also just like when you're thinking about a new chain, what the primary difference is between, like, say, Base and Polygon or an Arbitrum or Optimism, is that it's a new ecosystem.
21:32 - 21:38: Alexander Cutler: So when you're looking at something like an Arbitrum or an Optimism, like the vast majority of the liquidity and the developers that are building on there.
21:38 - 21:44: Alexander Cutler: They're all very Ethereum centric, they're all coming from Ethereum.
21:44 - 21:49: Alexander Cutler: And so, you know, what that means is that the liquidity, it's just really fragmented and it's all just kind of like the same liquidity just moving around between different chains.
21:49 - 21:55: Alexander Cutler: When you look at Base, what we're seeing is that a lot of the liquidity is actually new to crypto.
21:55 - 22:00: Alexander Cutler: So it's not just the same users with the same capital that are moving around between chains.

22:21 - 22:26: Alexander Cutler: There's not this like super high tax of like, hey, we're an Arbitrum, we're an Optimism, like, you're going to pay us 10% of your tokens for just existing on our chain.
22:26 - 22:31: Alexander Cutler: They're trying to be much more neutral in a sense and say, hey, like, we want you to succeed.

26:00 - 26:05: Camila Russo: Super exciting and congratulations again, Alex, on a really successful launch of Aerodrome on Base.
26:05 - 26:15: Camila Russo: And I think it's definitely going to be interesting to see how this space evolves with Base bringing in so many new users, because it's something that we've been struggling to do across different chains for so long.
26:15 - 26:19: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think it's a few things.
26:19 - 26:24: Alexander Cutler: So, you know, first and foremost, I think Base has done an amazing job positioning themselves as, you know, this kind of new neutral chain for Web3.

33:56 - 34:00: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think it's a few things.
34:00 - 34:05: Alexander Cutler: So, you know, first and foremost, I think Base has done an amazing job positioning themselves as, you know, this kind of new neutral chain for Web3.
34:05 - 34:11: Alexander Cutler: They've done a really, really good job of saying, like, hey, we're not going to be like an OP chain or an Arbitrum chain, where, you know, they're really heavily focused on the Ethereum ecosystem and building up that.
34:11 - 34:16: Alexander Cutler: They're really focused on, like, a new set of users that they can bring into the ecosystem that have nothing to do with crypto itself.
34:16 - 34:20: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's super important, just like from a marketing perspective.
34:20 - 34:25: Alexander Cutler: I think what they've done with friend.tech, what they've done with some of these other things, have really attracted a lot of new users who like, you know, a lot of them don't even know that they're interacting with crypto.
34:25 - 34:30: Alexander Cutler: They just know that it's just this new cool thing that they're using to trade influence or whatever.
34:30 - 34:35: Alexander Cutler: And so I think that's super important just for like new user onboarding.
34:35 - 34:40: Alexander Cutler: And also just like when you're thinking about a new chain, what the primary difference is between, like, say, Base and Polygon or an Arbitrum or Optimism, is that it's a new ecosystem.
34:40 - 34:46: Alexander Cutler: So when you're looking at something like an Arbitrum or an Optimism, like the vast majority of the liquidity and the developers that are building on there.
34:46 - 34:52: Alexander Cutler: They're all very Ethereum centric, they're all coming from Ethereum.
34:52 - 34:57: Alexander Cutler: And so, you know, what that means is that the liquidity, it's just really fragmented and it's all just kind of like the same liquidity just moving around between different chains.
34:57 - 35:03: Alexander Cutler: When you look at Base, what we're seeing is that a lot of the liquidity is actually new to crypto.
35:03 - 35:08: Alexander Cutler: So it's not just the same users with the same capital that are moving around between chains.
35:08 - 35:12: Alexander Cutler: It's actually attracting new users into the ecosystem because the applications that are building on there are just attracting them in from all sorts of different vectors.
35:12 - 35:17: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's something really special and what makes Base such a like a unique place to build on.
35:17 - 35:22: Alexander Cutler: And then secondly, just from a developer perspective, they've done an excellent job of just making it very easy to build on there.
35:22 - 35:28: Alexander Cutler: And also like, I think another big thing that they've really leaned into is building on there.
35:28 - 35:33: Alexander Cutler: There's not this like super high tax of like, hey, we're an Arbitrum, we're an Optimism, like, you're going to pay us 10% of your tokens for just existing on our chain.
35:33 - 35:38: Alexander Cutler: They're trying to be much more neutral in a sense and say, hey, like, we want you to succeed.
35:38 - 35:43: Alexander Cutler: We want you to like thrive, we want you to, like, bring new users into the ecosystem.
35:43 - 35:47: Alexander Cutler: And we're not going to like try to tax you out the wazoo or like, try to pull, like, any type of economic rent just for you existing.
35:47 - 35:50: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's another big differentiator that has made Base successful for attracting both users and developers.
35:50 - 35:55: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think it's a few things.
35:55 - 36:00: Alexander Cutler: So, you know, first and foremost, I think Base has done an amazing job positioning themselves as, you know, this kind of new neutral chain for Web3.
36:00 - 36:06: Alexander Cutler: They've done a really, really good job of saying, like, hey, we're not going to be like an OP chain or an Arbitrum chain, where, you know, they're really heavily focused on the Ethereum ecosystem and building up that.
36:06 - 36:11: Alexander Cutler: They're really focused on, like, a new set of users that they can bring into the ecosystem that have nothing to do with crypto itself.
36:11 - 36:15: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's super important, just like from a marketing perspective.
36:15 - 36:20: Alexander Cutler: I think what they've done with friend.tech, what they've done with some of these other things, have really attracted a lot of new users who like, you know, a lot of them don't even know that they're interacting with crypto.

36:52 - 36:58: Alexander Cutler: When you look at Base, what we're seeing is that a lot of the liquidity is actually new to crypto.
36:58 - 37:03: Alexander Cutler: So it's not just the same users with the same capital that are moving around between chains.
37:03 - 37:08: Alexander Cutler: It's actually attracting new users into the ecosystem because the applications that are building on there are just attracting them in from all sorts of different vectors.
37:08 - 37:11: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's something really special and what makes Base such a like a unique place to build on.
37:11 - 37:12: Young man: Hey everyone, I'm Illya,
37:12 - 37:15: Young man: and I'm inviting everyone to Bangkok, November 9 to 11.
37:15 - 37:16: Video glitch.
37:16 - 37:18: Computer voice: duped into thinking anything decentralized.
37:18 - 37:23: Computer voice: was ever going to work, there's a better way. Stop wasting your time with all this blockchain.
37:23 - 37:29: Computer voice: And go back to the norm. Get a latte and stop trying to change the world.
37:29 - 37:32: Computer voice: Oh, and this thing in November, redacted, the hackathon.
37:32 - 37:37: Computer voice: There are cushy office jobs, everything is working as it should.
37:37 - 37:39: Video glitch.
37:39 - 37:48: Young man: For our special event, we're going to dive into AI, Web3, Chain Abstraction, Decentralization, and User-owned AI.
37:48 - 37:52: Terminal window showing text: "MAXIS NEED NOT APPLY" "An IRL Movement" "REDACTEDBANGKOK.AI" "[AVANI+ BANGKOK]" "[9-11 NOVEMBER]"
37:52 - 38:00: Camila Russo: And I think that's something that we've been struggling to do across different chains for so long.
38:00 - 38:04: Camila Russo: So super exciting and congratulations again, Alex, on a really successful launch of Aerodrome on Base.
38:04 - 38:08: Camila Russo: And I think it's definitely going to be interesting to see how this space evolves with Base.
38:08 - 38:15: Camila Russo: Yeah. That's what everyone wants, to bring new people into the crypto ecosystem.
38:15 - 38:20: Camila Russo: This is like the holy grail of bringing new people into the crypto ecosystem.
38:20 - 38:24: Camila Russo: Yes, so I mean, that's why this is so interesting is that you also have Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, and then Base come in and it's not just attracting the same liquidity that's rotating between chains.
38:24 - 38:28: Camila Russo: You're saying it's bringing completely new users, which is the holy grail.
38:28 - 38:33: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think it's a few things.
38:33 - 38:38: Alexander Cutler: So, you know, first and foremost, I think Base has done an amazing job positioning themselves as, you know, this kind of new neutral chain for Web3.

38:57 - 39:02: Alexander Cutler: They just know that it's just this new cool thing that they're using to trade influence or whatever.

48:09 - 48:13: Alexander Cutler: And we're not going to like try to tax you out the wazoo or like, try to pull, like, any type of economic rent just for you existing.
48:13 - 48:17: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's another big differentiator that has made Base successful for attracting both users and developers.
48:17 - 48:22: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think it's a few things.
48:22 - 48:27: Alexander Cutler: So, you know, first and foremost, I think Base has done an amazing job positioning themselves as, you know, this kind of new neutral chain for Web3.
48:27 - 48:32: Alexander Cutler: They've done a really, really good job of saying, like, hey, we're not going to be like an OP chain or an Arbitrum chain, where, you know, they're really heavily focused on the Ethereum ecosystem and building up that.
48:32 - 48:38: Alexander Cutler: They're really focused on, like, a new set of users that they can bring into the ecosystem that have nothing to do with crypto itself.
48:38 - 48:42: Alexander Cutler: So I think that's super important, just like from a marketing perspective.
48:42 - 48:47: Alexander Cutler: I think what they've done with friend.tech, what they've done with some of these other things, have really attracted a lot of new users who like, you know, a lot of them don't even know that they're interacting with crypto.
48:47 - 48:52: Alexander Cutler: They just know that it's just this new cool thing that they're using to trade influence or whatever.
48:52 - 48:57: Alexander Cutler: And so I think that's super important just for like new user onboarding.
48:57 - 50:04: Alexander Cutler: And also just like when you're thinking about a new chain, what the primary difference is between, like, say, Base and Polygon or an Arbitrum or Optimism, is that it's a new ecosystem. So when you're looking at something like an Arbitrum or an Optimism, like the vast majority of the liquidity and the developers that are building on there. They're all very Ethereum centric, they're all coming from Ethereum. And so, you know, what that means is that the liquidity, it's just really fragmented and it's all just kind of like the same liquidity just moving around between different chains. When you look at Base, what we're seeing is that a lot of the liquidity is actually new to crypto. So it's not just the same users with the same capital that are moving around between chains. It's actually attracting new users into the ecosystem because the applications that are building on there are just attracting them in from all sorts of different vectors. So I think that's something really special and what makes Base such a like a unique place to build on. And then secondly, just from a developer perspective, they've done an excellent job of just making it very easy to build on there. And also like, I think another big thing that they've really leaned into is building on there. There's not this like super high tax of like, hey, we're an Arbitrum, we're an Optimism, like, you're going to pay us 10% of your tokens for just existing on our chain. They're trying to be much more neutral in a sense and say, hey, like, we want you to succeed. We want you to like thrive, we want you to, like, bring new users into the ecosystem. And we're not going to like try to tax you out the wazoo or like, try to pull, like, any type of economic rent just for you existing. So I think that's another big differentiator that has made Base successful for attracting both users and developers.
50:04 - 50:05: Alexander Cutler: So Alex, thanks so much for joining me.
50:05 - 50:06: Camila Russo: And that's super interesting.
50:06 - 50:08: Camila Russo: You said Base is bringing completely new users to crypto.
50:08 - 50:09: Camila Russo: That's the holy grail.
50:09 - 50:11: Camila Russo: That's what everybody wants in this space.
50:11 - 50:19: Alexander Cutler: Yeah, no, absolutely. I mean, I think it's a few things.

Here is a summary of the ways discussed in the video:
The video discusses several key aspects of the evolution and impact of stablecoins and the broader financial industry:
Financial Inclusion: Reeve Collins, co-founder of Tether, highlights how stablecoins and blockchain technology can provide financial services to the unbanked and underbanked populations worldwide. This is achieved by offering a way to access and transact with stable currencies like the US dollar through a mobile phone.
Decentralized Banking: The conversation explores the concept of decentralized banking, where users can have more control over their funds and participate in a more transparent financial system. This moves away from the reliance on traditional intermediaries.
Evolution of Stablecoins (Stablecoin 2.0): Collins introduces the idea of "Stablecoin 2.0," which involves using tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) as backing for stablecoins. This allows for the creation of more transparent and potentially yield-bearing stablecoins, where the users who provide the collateral can earn the interest.
User-Centric Financial Products: The discussion emphasizes a shift towards financial products where the end-users receive the value. This contrasts with the traditional model where intermediaries often capture most of the profits.
Increased Competition and Innovation: The entry of major financial players like Visa, JP Morgan, and Mastercard into the stablecoin space is seen as a driver of competition and innovation. This is expected to lead to better and more efficient financial services for consumers.
Mass Adoption of Cryptocurrency: The growing acceptance and regulation of cryptocurrencies, particularly the holding of Bitcoin on corporate balance sheets and the potential for tokenized assets in retirement accounts, are viewed as paving the way for mainstream adoption of digital assets.

### Tutorial 1: How to Swap Tokens on Aerodrome Finance

Swapping tokens on Aerodrome is straightforward, leveraging its automated market maker (AMM) for low-slippage trades. This is ideal for exchanging assets like ETH for USDC or other Base-native tokens. Ensure you're on the Base network (an Ethereum L2) with a compatible wallet like MetaMask or Coinbase Wallet.

#### Prerequisites
- A Web3 wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect) connected to the Base network.
- ETH on Base for gas fees (bridge from Ethereum mainnet via the official Base bridge at bridge.base.org if needed).
- Tokens to swap (e.g., USDC, ETH, or any supported asset).

#### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Visit the Aerodrome Website: Go to https://aerodrome.finance. This is the official centralized interface. For added security, use decentralized alternatives like aero.drome.eth or aero.drome.eth.limo if preferred.
   
2. Connect Your Wallet: Click "Connect Wallet" in the top-right corner. Select your wallet provider and approve the connection. Ensure your wallet is switched to the Base network (Chain ID: 8453). If not, add it manually in MetaMask: RPC URL https://mainnet.base.org, Symbol ETH.

3. Navigate to the Swap Interface: By default, the homepage loads the swap tab. If not, click "Swap" in the left menu.

4. Select Tokens and Amount: 
   - In the "From" field, select the token you want to swap (e.g., ETH). Enter the amount.
   - In the "To" field, select the desired output token (e.g., AERO). The platform auto-calculates the output based on current liquidity and rates.
   - Over 180 tokens are supported; use the search bar for less common ones.
   - Review details: Exchange rate, slippage tolerance (default 0.5%—adjust if needed for volatile pairs), price impact, and estimated gas fees.

5. Approve and Confirm the Swap:
   - If swapping a non-native token, approve the contract to spend your tokens (one-time per token).
   - Click "Swap" and confirm the transaction in your wallet. Pay the gas fee (typically low on Base, ~$0.01–$0.10).
   - Wait for confirmation (usually 1–5 seconds on Base).

6. Verify the Transaction: Check your wallet balance for the new tokens. Use Basescan (basescan.org) to view the tx hash for details.

#### Tips and Best Practices
- Slippage and Price Impact: For large trades, increase slippage to 1–3% to avoid failures, but monitor for high impact (>5%) indicating low liquidity.
- MEV Protection: Aerodrome's Slipstream (upcoming V2) offers intent-based routing for better execution.
- Fees: Dynamic fees (0.01%–1%) based on pool type; 100% go to veAERO voters.
- Common Issues: If the swap fails, check gas limits or network congestion. Use a VPN if geo-restricted.
- Advanced: For cross-chain swaps (e.g., Solana assets), use upcoming bridging features.

This process is similar for buying specific tokens like $VTN or others via liquidity pools.

### Tutorial 2: How to Provide Liquidity on Aerodrome Finance

Providing liquidity earns you trading fees and AERO emissions. It's key for passive income but involves impermanent loss risk.

#### Prerequisites
- Wallet connected to Base with tokens for the pool (e.g., equal value of Token A and Token B).
- ETH for gas.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Access the Liquidity Tab: On https://aerodrome.finance, click "Liquidity" in the left menu.

2. Select or Search for a Pool: 
   - Browse 399+ pools categorized by active, stable, volatile, incentivized, or low TVL.
   - Search by token (e.g., AERO-USDC). Check APR (e.g., 4%–500+%) and TVL for liquidity health.

3. Deposit Tokens:
   - Enter amounts for both tokens (auto-balances for 50/50 pairs).
   - Approve contracts if needed.
   - Click "Deposit" and confirm in wallet.

4. Stake LP Tokens in a Gauge (Optional for Emissions): 
   - After depositing, receive LP tokens.
   - Go to the pool's gauge and stake LP to earn AERO rewards.

5. Monitor and Manage: Use dashboards to track APR, emissions, and impermanent loss.

Concentrated Liquidity Efficiency 🚰

Aerodrome's Slipstream concentrated liquidity pools offer a novel way to maximize capital efficiency and earn higher rewards for LPs.

Here's a primer on Slipstream CL pools and how you can earn more AERO with less liquidity. ✈️

Traditional pools or vAMM use a constant product formula, spreading liquidity evenly across all price ranges.

While effective and a core primitive of most DEXs, vAMM pools can be inefficient for tokens that support large volumes with limited liquidity.

CL pools allow LPs to focus their capital within defined price ranges, which can result in deeper liquidity around the active price, reducing slippage and improving the trading experience.

Additionally, CL pools enable better capital efficiency and higher rewards for LPs.

Some of the benefits of CL Pools include:
• Higher Capital Efficiency: Lower slippage and improved trading.
• Increased Rewards: LPs can generate more AERO rewards per token deposited.
